/**
 * The shape of one distribution, which is what a box plot structurally cannot
 * show: these 75 samples have two humps in them — a warm cache path and a cold
 * one — and the same numbers draw a single tidy box that says nothing about
 * either. Left to itself the chart bins by Freedman–Diaconis, 2 times IQR times
 * n to the power of minus a third, which reads the interquartile range rather
 * than the range, so one far outlier cannot stretch the picture into one tall
 * bar and forty empty ones. Say which rule drew the histogram, as the
 * description does here, because the shape is a property of the bin width as
 * much as of the data.
