 * Buckets that arrived already counted, at the widths a metrics backend chose,
 * getting wider as the values grow. Under frequency the 100 to 250 bucket reads
 * as a real shoulder, and it is only there because that bucket is fifteen times
 * as wide as the first one — a wider bucket collects more observations at the
 * same underlying rate. density divides each count by n times the bucket width,
 * so the bars enclose an area of one and the tail flattens into what the data
 * actually says. Reach for it whenever the buckets are uneven, and whenever two
 * histograms of different sample sizes have to be compared.
