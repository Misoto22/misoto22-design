/**
 * A panel with controls in it, which is the whole distinction from a tooltip:
 * put a field or a button inside a tip and it is unreachable. label names the
 * panel and is announced on entry, so make it say what the panel holds rather
 * than repeating the trigger. showClose is off by default and turned on here
 * because the panel holds a form — a non-modal panel whose only exit is
 * clicking away gives an in-progress edit no deliberate end. It really is not
 * modal: there is no focus trap, so tabbing past the last control moves focus
 * into the page, which Radix reads as a focus-outside and closes the panel.
