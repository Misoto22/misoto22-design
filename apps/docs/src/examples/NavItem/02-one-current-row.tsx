/**
 * Two sections, one aria-current between them. Do not also mark the section a
 * page belongs to: active means aria-current="page", and two of them is a
 * reader told they are in two places at once. A group heading is a label rather
 * than a row — these kickers are not focusable and they do not navigate. Do not
 * tighten the rows either; they sit at --control-h-sm, 36px comfortable and
 * 30px under compact density, and a padding class below that leaves a column of
 * targets a thumb has to aim at.
 *
 * The nav is named for the example rather than for what it depicts. This page
 * is itself served out of a nav named "Documentation", and two landmarks of the
 * same role sharing a name cannot be told apart by anyone navigating by
 * landmark — including axe, which fails the page for it.
