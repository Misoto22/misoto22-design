/**
 * A panel that draws its own header — an eyebrow above the title, a badge
 * beside it — which the plain title line cannot express. hideTitle stops that
 * line rendering twice while title still names the dialog for a screen reader,
 * so pass it even here: with no title at all the accessible name falls back to
 * the literal word Dialog. hideTitle takes the description with it, because the
 * two share one wrapper, so anything the reader has to read goes in the
 * children. Leave showClose on, as it is by default: Escape and the scrim are
 * the only other ways out and neither of them is visible.
