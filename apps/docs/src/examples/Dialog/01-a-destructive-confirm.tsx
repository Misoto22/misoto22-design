/**
 * One question, two answers, and nothing else in the panel. Both controls are
 * wrapped in DialogClose rather than flipping state by hand: the close then
 * runs through Radix, which returns focus to the trigger instead of dropping it
 * at the top of the document. title is what names the modal — leave it out and
 * the fallback accessible name is the literal word Dialog, so every unnamed
 * modal in an app is announced as the same thing. Reach for this shape when the
 * answer is yes or no; anything longer has become a Sheet.
