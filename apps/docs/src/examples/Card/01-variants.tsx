/**
 * The bounded surface and the one reversed one, side by side. There is no
 * shadow under either: a card that needs to read as raised is a plate, which
 * separates by reversal because this system has no elevation ramp to raise it
 * with. Spend plate once per screen — a band of them is a band with no ground
 * left to reverse against. Use CardTitle inside it rather than your own
 * heading, too: plate re-points --card-title to --on-feature, and a title that
 * reads --ink directly comes out at 1.25:1 on that ground, invisible on the one
 * variant whose whole job is to look different.
