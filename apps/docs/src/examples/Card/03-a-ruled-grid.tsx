/**
 * flat is the ground for a card whose container already draws the rules between
 * cells — three outlined cards inside a bordered grid is three borders where
 * one was wanted. Two other things are load-bearing here. The box brings no
 * padding of its own, so children dropped straight in sit against the edge:
 * CardBody supplies it. And CardTitle is an h3 by default, which is right under
 * the h2 above it and wrong the moment a grid of twelve cards has no heading
 * for them to belong to — pass as to say which level this really is.
