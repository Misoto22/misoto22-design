/**
 * A whole card that acts as one target, without an onClick on the box. A Card
 * with a click handler is a div with a click handler: not focusable, not
 * announced, and unreachable by keyboard. The fix is a real control inside it,
 * stretched over the box with an absolutely positioned overlay — so what is
 * announced is a link with the title as its name, the focus ring lands on
 * something, and the entire card is still the hit area. The box needs position
 * relative for that to work, and anything the reader must also be able to click
 * separately has to sit above the overlay.
