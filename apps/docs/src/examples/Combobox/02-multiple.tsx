/**
 * Several at once, with the trigger summarising rather than listing: two labels,
 * then a count. That threshold is what stops the field growing with its value
 * and reflowing the form on every pick. The panel stays open while you choose,
 * and the clear control beside the chevron is a span with a button role — a
 * real nested button inside the trigger is invalid markup that browsers
 * reparent out of the field entirely. The trigger is named by its label and
 * its summary together — aria-labelledby pointing at both — so a screen reader
 * hears “Tags 3 selected” rather than only the label, and the count is
 * confirmable without opening the panel.
