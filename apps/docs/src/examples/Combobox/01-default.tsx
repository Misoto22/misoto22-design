/**
 * Seven bodies behind a filter that matches more than it prints: type compact
 * and two come up though neither says the word. Put readable text in label and
 * anything else worth matching in keywords — cmdk scores against the option's
 * value as well, so a list keyed by UUID is being ranked on a string no reader
 * will ever type. The highlight moves through aria-activedescendant while focus
 * stays in the input, which is why the typed text stays editable. Nothing
 * virtualises here: every option renders on open and stays there behind the
 * filter, so a thousand of them is a DOM cost, not a search cost.
