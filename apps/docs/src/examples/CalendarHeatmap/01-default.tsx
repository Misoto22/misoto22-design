/**
 * Half a year, built from the dates rather than from the order of the array —
 * which is the whole difference from a bare list of counts, where one missing
 * day shifts every reading after it by a cell and draws a plausible picture of
 * a year that did not happen. The fortnight in March is null rather than zero,
 * so it renders as a dashed gap and announces no data: nothing happened and
 * nothing was recorded are different readings, and a page that draws them alike
 * invites the reader to explain an outage that was a hole in collection.
 * describe names the unit, because the row and column a cell is announced with
 * are a weekday and a month over a block of five weeks.
