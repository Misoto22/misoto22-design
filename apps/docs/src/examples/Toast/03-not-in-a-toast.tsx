/**
 * The same failure twice: once in the page, once on a timer. Nothing a reader
 * must act on belongs in the one that vanishes — four seconds is a deadline
 * they were never told about, and the close button lives in a portal at the end
 * of body that a keyboard reaches last. Nothing they must read twice belongs
 * there either: there is no history, so once the timer expires the reference is
 * out of the DOM and unrecoverable. Press the button and watch the number go;
 * the Alert above it is still there, and still says what to do.
