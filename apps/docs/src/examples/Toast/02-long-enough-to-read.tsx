 * Four seconds is the default, and four seconds is roughly ten words read
 * aloud: anything longer than a short sentence needs a duration of its own, or
 * the rest of it is removed from the page before it has been read. Keep the
 * message to what happened, too — three toasts are visible at once and the rest
 * queue, so a loop that toasts per item shows the last three and delivers the
 * others after the reader has moved on. There is no Toaster in this example on
 * purpose: the one mounted by the first example on this page is the only one
 * the page should have.
