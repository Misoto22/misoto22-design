/**
 * The panel works in OKLCH, which is the whole argument for it over the native
 * picker. In HSV — what <input type="color"> and most libraries use — a row of
 * constant lightness visibly darkens as it saturates, so somebody building a
 * palette is fighting the instrument. Here two colours at the same height on
 * the plane genuinely match, and the hue strip is taken at the lightness
 * already chosen rather than being a rainbow belonging to some other colour.
 *
 * The plane is a pair of real sliders under a painted canvas, so the arrows
 * move it and a screen reader is told which axis it is on.
