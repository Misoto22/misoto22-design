 * The mark, inside the anchor and as its last child. Outside it, it is an arrow
 * pointing at a link the pointer misses by 0.22em. The glyph is set in em so it
 * tracks the type beside it rather than competing with it, and it is
 * aria-hidden — nothing is announced by putting it here, so the link's own
 * words still have to say where they go.
