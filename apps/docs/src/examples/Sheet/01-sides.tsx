 * The four edges, named in reading order rather than as left and right: end is
 * the right in English and the left in Arabic, from one class string carrying
 * its own rtl variant, so there is no second code path to keep in step. Flip
 * this canvas to RTL and watch start and end swap. start and end are a
 * min(24rem, 92vw) column at full height; top and bottom are a full-width band
 * capped at 85vh. Every sheet has a close button whichever edge it comes from —
 * there is no showClose to turn it off, unlike Dialog.
