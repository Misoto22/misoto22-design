/**
 * The whole opening, in the order it is fixed in: trail, kicker, title, then
 * the sentence under it. The range picker sits beside the title rather than
 * above the content because it qualifies what the title refers to — it says
 * which slice of the archive this page is about, and below the rule it would
 * become a toolbar arguing with whatever strip the page starts with. The title
 * is --fs-heading at every level, because moving an opening down the outline is
 * a fact about the document and not a request for smaller type — level={2} here
 * only because this documentation page already owns the h1. The trail carries a
 * label of its own for the same reason: two navigation landmarks with the same
 * name are indistinguishable to anyone navigating by landmark, which is also
 * why the guidance is to leave breadcrumb off inside a shell that pins a trail.
