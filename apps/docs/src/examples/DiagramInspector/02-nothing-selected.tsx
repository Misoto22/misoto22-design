/**
 * The panel has no empty state of its own — title is required, so there is no
 * way to render one with nothing in it, and what a reader sees before they pick
 * anything is the caller’s to draw. Draw something: a column that vanishes when
 * the selection clears takes the rest of the layout with it every time somebody
 * closes the panel. The relationship row is a real button because it carries
 * onSelect, which is what lets a keyboard walk the graph peer by peer without
 * ever reaching the picture; onClose returns to the empty case.
