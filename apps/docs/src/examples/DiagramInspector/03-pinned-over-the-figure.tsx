/**
 * floating turns the panel into a plate pinned to the bottom-left of the nearest
 * positioned ancestor, so the wrapper has to establish one or it will pin itself
 * to something further up the page. Pin it when the figure owns the viewport and
 * a panel in the flow underneath would be off-screen at the moment it is needed;
 * leave it inline when the figure is one item in an article. activeIds lights the
 * same node the panel is about, and neither reaches into the other — the picture
 * and the panel are two consumers of one selection. actions is where what a
 * reader does with the selection goes. The region takes its accessible name from
 * title, so two panels on one page must not inspect the same node — this one
 * selects the datastore rather than the service the first example is about.
