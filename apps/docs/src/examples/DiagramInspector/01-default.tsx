 * What a selection puts on the screen: the kind of thing it is, its name, the

 * with the direction spelled out. It is a labelled region with aria-live, not a
 * dialog — the reader clicked a node rather than opening a panel, so nothing
 * here traps focus or has to be dismissed before the page works again. mono is
 * for values a reader may retype; the facts are a definition list, so a screen
 * reader can say which value belongs to which label.
