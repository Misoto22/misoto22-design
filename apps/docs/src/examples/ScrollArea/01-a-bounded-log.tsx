/**
 * The height on the root is what makes any of this happen: with none, the box
 * is as tall as its content, nothing overflows, and all the component added to
 * the page was a keyboard stop. That stop is the reason to reach for this over
 * a bare overflow-auto — Radix keeps the viewport focusable and the bar
 * operable, so everything past the fold is reachable without a mouse. label is
 * required for the same reason: an unnamed keyboard stop announces group and
 * nothing else. For a page-level or prose scroll the scroll-slim utility is
 * lighter and needs no component at all.
