 * The same tone, twice: pulsing means something is happening right now, and it
 * is the default — so a dot for a build that finished, or a status that will
 * not change today, announces work that is not being done unless pulse is set
 * to false. The halo is motion-safe, so a reader who asked for less motion gets
 * the still dot either way.
