 * A dot inside the chip rather than beside it. Badge spaces its children 6px
 * apart, so a StatusDot needs no wrapper of its own — and the dot is
 * aria-hidden, so the word next to it has to name the state on its own. Reach
 * for this in a table cell where the row already supplies the subject; a state
 * that is the whole line is a StatusPill.
