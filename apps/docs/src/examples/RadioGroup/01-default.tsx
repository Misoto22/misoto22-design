 * Three options and one tab stop: the arrows move between them, which is the
 * ARIA radiogroup pattern and the half a stack of hand-rolled radios usually
 * loses. aria-label is not optional — the root is a div, so htmlFor, including
 * the one a Field draws, binds to nothing and the group would be announced with
 * no name at all. defaultValue matters as much: selection follows focus here,
 * so a group that starts empty commits an answer on behalf of anyone who
 * arrows past it on the way to the next field.
