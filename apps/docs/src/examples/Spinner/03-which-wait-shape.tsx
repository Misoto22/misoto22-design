/**
 * Three waits, three shapes, and the question each one answers. A Spinner is
 * for a wait whose length nobody knows and whose result has no shape worth
 * promising. A Skeleton is for a wait where the shape is known — it holds the
 * layout so the page does not jump when the records land. A Progress is for a
 * wait with a real fraction, and only a real one: a bar filled from an invented
 * estimate is a spinner that lies. Reaching for the spinner in all three cases
 * is the usual failure, and it is the one of the three that says least.
