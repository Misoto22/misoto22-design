/**
 * Two spinners standing on a ground that is not paper. The default tone draws
 * the leading quarter in --ink over a --rule-2 track, and inside a filled
 * control both of those are the ground it is sitting on — so pass tone current
 * and let the ring inherit the text colour. label null belongs to exactly this
 * case: the control already names the operation, and passing it hides the whole
 * element from assistive tech rather than merely dropping the text, so a
 * silenced spinner standing on its own is a wait nobody is told about.
