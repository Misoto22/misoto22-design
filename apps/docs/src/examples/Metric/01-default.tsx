/**
 * Four across, which is the arrangement this exists for. The figures are
 * monospace and tabular by construction, so the same magnitude is the same
 * width in every tile and the column reads as a column rather than as four
 * unrelated numbers. Each tone dot is aria-hidden, so whatever it means is in
 * the line under the figure as well — a tile whose only account of a failure is
 * that it is red says nothing at all to a screen reader, and nothing in
 * greyscale. Every value arrives already formatted: the locale, the unit and
 * the currency are the application's decision, made once rather than guessed
 * four times.
