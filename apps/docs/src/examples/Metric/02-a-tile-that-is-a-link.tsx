 * asChild hands the whole plate to the caller's own element, which is how a
 * tile becomes a link without this package importing a router. The slotted
 * child takes no children of its own — the label, the figure and the line under
 * them are injected into it, so an anchor written as a self-closing tag is the
 * whole call. Because the tile IS the link, its accessible name is every word
 * in it read in order, which is the reason to keep the detail line short here
 * even where a longer one would read fine on a plain tile.
