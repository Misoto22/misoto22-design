 * Four figures, which with two is one of the only counts that fits: the grid is
 * two columns until the wrapper reaches @3xl and four after, so three leaves a
 * hole in both arrangements and five leaves three. id is required rather than
 * optional because it is the React key — an index would put the next render's
 * number under the previous label as soon as the list reordered.
