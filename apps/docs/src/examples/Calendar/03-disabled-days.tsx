/**
 * Weekends and anything before the 7th are refused, and the grid will not
 * commit one: disabled takes matchers — a day of the week, a date range, a
 * predicate — and dims the buttons it covers rather than removing them, so the
 * month keeps its shape and the reader can see WHY a day is unavailable. This
 * is also where an availability view starts: mark the cells through the
 * classNames slots, not by styling the day button, and the marks stay
 * compatible with the range wash. startMonth and endMonth bound how far the
 * caption's picker will travel; the default is ten years either side, which is
 * one page of the year grid and no paging at all.
 *
 * labels.labelNav names the month arrows' toolbar. Left alone every calendar
 * on a page is a nav called "Navigation bar" — react-day-picker's own string
 * — and three examples on one page are three landmarks nobody can tell apart.
