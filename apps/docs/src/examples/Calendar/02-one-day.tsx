/**
 * One day at a time, and the two marks that must not look alike: today is a
 * RING and selected is a FILL. One is a fact about the calendar and the other
 * is a choice the reader made, so a system that draws both the same way leaves
 * the reader unable to tell what they picked. Days from the neighbouring months
 * are shown and dimmed rather than left as holes. Do not give the grid a fixed
 * height — most months are five weeks and some are six — and do not stretch it
 * with w-full: it is w-fit and lays out fixed 36px columns, so a width class
 * only leaves the same grid sitting at the start edge of a wider box. For
 * choosing a date inside a form, this belongs in a DatePicker.
 *
 * labels.labelNav names the month arrows' toolbar. Left alone every calendar
 * on a page is a nav called "Navigation bar" — react-day-picker's own string
 * — and three examples on one page are three landmarks nobody can tell apart.
