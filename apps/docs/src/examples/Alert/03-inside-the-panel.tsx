 * One panel failed; the rest of the page still works. This is the case a

 * panel keeps both the error and the way past it. Reach for the page-sized
 * state only when the page itself could not be shown. The tone here is warning
 * rather than danger for the same reason: nothing the reader did has failed,
 * and danger is assertive enough to interrupt whatever they were reading
 * elsewhere on the page.
