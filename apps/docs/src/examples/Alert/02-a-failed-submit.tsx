/**
 * An error that has to persist, with the way out inside it. Put the retry in
 * action rather than describing it in the prose: action sits inside the live
 * region, which is the difference between the announcement telling the reader
 * what to do and merely telling them something is wrong. Mount the Alert when
 * there is something to say and unmount it when there is not — a region kept
 * permanently in the page announces only when its words change, so a second
 * failed submit carrying the same message is announced to nobody. Move focus to
 * it, or to the field it names: it announces and then stays put, so a keyboard
 * reader hears the error from wherever they were standing.
