/**
 * The four tones, in the order they escalate. The tone is the message's
 * severity and not its decoration: danger carries role alert and interrupts
 * whatever the screen reader was saying, because what the reader is doing is
 * already failing, and the other three carry role status and wait for a pause.
 * Colour is doubled by the icon and by the words, so the meaning survives
 * monochrome printing and colour-blindness — which is what hideIcon takes away,
 * leaving the severity on a wash at 13 to 16 per cent alpha. Do not stack them
 * as a running log: five on a page are five live regions competing for one
 * speech queue, and the danger among them cuts off the four that explain it.
