/**
 * Under `breakpoint` the rail is not a narrower rail, it is a different
 * component: an overlay that covers the page from its own edge, closes onto a
 * scrim, and is `inert` while shut. That last part is the one everybody skips.
 * A drawer merely translated off-screen still holds focus and is still read
 * aloud, so a closed one puts its whole index between the reader and the page
 * they were on — which is why closing it here removes it from the document
 * rather than moving it.
 *
 * Two settings make this a demonstration rather than a description. `contained`
 * points the overlay at the frame instead of the window, because `fixed`
 * resolves against the viewport wherever the markup sits and a drawer inside a
 * preview would otherwise open across the page it is previewed on. And the
 * breakpoint is the widest step there is, so the state being documented is the
 * state on screen — this frame is never wider than `xl`.
 *
 * A row closes it. Following a link inside an overlay and leaving the overlay
 * up is a reader landing somewhere they cannot see.
