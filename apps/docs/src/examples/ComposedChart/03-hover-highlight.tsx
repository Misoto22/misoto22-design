/**
 * Hovering a column dims every bar outside it. The highlight reads the chart's
 * own tooltip index, which is the half that was missing where this came from: the
 * state existed and was cleared on leave, but nothing ever set it, so the
 * highlight never fired. It is driven by the pointer, so it can never be the only
 * thing carrying a reading — the clickable legend, the tooltip and the figure's
 * hidden data table are what a keyboard reaches instead.
