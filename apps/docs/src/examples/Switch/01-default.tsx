/**
 * Two settings that take effect on the flip rather than on a save — which is
 * the whole line between this and Checkbox, and not a cosmetic one: a switch
 * inside a form with a Save button is a lie about when the change happened.
 * Both are named for the state and not for the action, because the name is read
 * together with “on” or “off”: “Email notifications, on” is a sentence, and
 * “Turn on email notifications, on” is two contradictory ones. The Radix root
 * is a button, which a label does bind to, so unlike Select or RadioGroup a
 * Field's label above a Switch really does click through.
