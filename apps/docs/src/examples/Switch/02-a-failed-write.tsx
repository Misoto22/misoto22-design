/**
 * The flip has already claimed the change happened, so a write that fails has
 * to be handled at the control: put the thumb back, and say why. Turn this one
 * on — the request behind it fails a moment later, the switch returns to off
 * and the reason appears beneath it. A switch left on over a write that never
 * landed is a page showing a setting the server does not have. Keep the flip
 * itself instant even when the write is not: an optimistic thumb with a quiet
 * undo beats a spinner on a control whose whole claim is that it already took
 * effect.
