/**
 * A fan-out, and the reason classification is a field rather than a word in the
 * label: one table feeds three consumers and each arrow leaves carrying
 * something different. Three flows share a single face here, so the router
 * spreads their ports across it — stacked on the face midpoint instead, three
 * arrowheads would read as one. The ad partner is the only consumer outside the
 * account, which is why its flow is the one drawn as crossing a boundary.
