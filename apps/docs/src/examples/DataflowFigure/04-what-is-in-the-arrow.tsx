/**
 * Four stages, because minimisation is a stage: the reviewer's question is
 * whether anything still labelled PII reaches the warehouse, and the answer is
 * a line you follow rather than a paragraph you trust. Every classification is
 * folded into the accessible summary as well as printed on the chip, so a
 * reader who cannot see the picture gets card and email — PII rather than card
 * and email alone. Keep the wording and the classification apart even when they
 * feel like one phrase; the moment they merge, the chip stops being a field
 * anything can be checked against.
