 * Two sources joining at one gate. The mono chip under each label is the
 * classification, printed apart from the wording because a pipeline gets read
 * for what is inside the arrow rather than for what the arrow is called —
 * clickstream and no PII answer different questions, and only one of them is the
 * question a governance reviewer arrived with. The stage headings are the axis,
 * so how far something has got is answered by looking up rather than by tracing.
