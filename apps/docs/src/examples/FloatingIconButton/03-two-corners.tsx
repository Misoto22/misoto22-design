/**
 * Both corners, and the reason there is no room for a third. start is raised to
 * 5rem while end sits at 1.5rem, which is exactly the clearance a pair needs —
 * and the corners are already competing with a cookie bar, a chat launcher and
 * whatever the browser puts in the corner where reading begins, which is why
 * start is the higher of the two. The control is --control-h-md square: 44px at
 * the default density, which is the pointer-target floor, and 36px under
 * data-density="compact". Flip the density switch above and the one control a
 * thumb reaches for without looking drops eight pixels under it.
