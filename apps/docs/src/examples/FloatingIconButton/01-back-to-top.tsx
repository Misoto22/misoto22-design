/**
 * A page-level affordance that stays reachable while the reader scrolls.
 * position is required and has no default, and its values are start and end in
 * reading order — end is the right in English and the left in Arabic. label is
 * set as aria-label and never renders, so a screen reader has the name and a
 * sighted reader has the glyph alone: pick a glyph that carries the meaning, or
 * wrap it in a Tooltip. The control is fixed to the viewport in real use; the
 * box around it here is what keeps the preview honest, since a fixed element
 * inside a transformed ancestor pins to that ancestor instead of the screen.
