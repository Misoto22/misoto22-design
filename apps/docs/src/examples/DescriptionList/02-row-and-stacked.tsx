/**
 * The same three fields under both layouts. row is the record-page shape — the
 * labels line up down one edge and a reader scans them rather than reading
 * them — and it collapses to one column under the sm breakpoint, because a
 * 12rem label column on a phone leaves the value about eight characters wide.
 * stacked keeps the value under its label at every width, which is the answer
 * for a container that is narrow by design rather than by viewport: a card, a
 * sidebar, a popover. Pick by the container, not by the number of fields.
