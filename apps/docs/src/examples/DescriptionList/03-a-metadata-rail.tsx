 * The shape it was built for: a detail page with the record on the left and its
 * metadata in a rail beside it. The rail is stacked and undivided — it is
 * already inside a bordered column, and a second set of hairlines inside one
 * box is a grid pretending to be a table. Everything in the rail is a fact
 * about the thing rather than part of it, which is the line to draw when
 * deciding what belongs here: the title and the body are the record, the owner
 * and the last deploy are what the page knows about it.
