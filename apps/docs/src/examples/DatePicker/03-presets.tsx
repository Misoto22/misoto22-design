 * default for a range, because “last 30 days” is most of what a range picker is
 * ever asked for while a single date is usually a specific one. They are plain
 * buttons rather than a menu, so they set the same value the grid sets and Tab
 * in the same pass as it. Each shortcut is computed on the click, not at render:
 * a list built once freezes “today” at whenever the page loaded.
