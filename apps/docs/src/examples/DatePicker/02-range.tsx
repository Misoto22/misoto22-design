/**
 * Two months side by side, because a range that crosses a month boundary is the
 * common case and paging back and forth to see both ends is what makes a range
 * picker tiring. The panel stays open until both ends are chosen — a range is
 * not a value until it has a second date — and while only one end is set the
 * trigger prints “from – …”, so a half-answered range says so on the closed
 * control instead of looking finished. That half state is legal, so validate
 * before reading the second date: a reader who closed the panel early leaves it
 * undefined.
