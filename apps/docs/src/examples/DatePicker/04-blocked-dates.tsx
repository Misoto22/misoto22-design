 * disabledDates goes straight through to the calendar: past days and weekends
 * are refused here, and the grid will not commit one. Note there is no preset
 * rail beside it — the shortcuts call their value straight into the same setter
 * the grid uses and are never tested against disabledDates, so a rail next to
 * these rules would happily commit a Sunday the grid itself refuses. If you
 * want both, check each preset by hand. Reach for disabledDates rather than
 * disabled, too: disabled takes the trigger out of the tab order and blocks its
 * pointer events, and the trigger is the only place the chosen date is printed.
