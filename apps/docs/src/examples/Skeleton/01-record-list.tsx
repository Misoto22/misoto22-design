/**
 * The skeleton for the list that replaces it, built on the same grid — a 9rem
 * plate beside a kicker, a title and two lines of prose. That match is the
 * whole job: a skeleton whose shape differs from what lands is a layout shift
 * the reader was warned about and then subjected to anyway. One SkeletonPage
 * wraps the lot, so there is one live region, one sentence read aloud and one
 * pulse rather than eight bars breathing out of phase. Nothing here flips
 * aria-busy to false — the frame is unmounted, not updated — so whatever
 * replaces it has to announce itself or take focus.
