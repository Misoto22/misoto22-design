/**
 * Five files behind one trigger, grouped by what they are for: PNG, JPEG and
 * WebP are the artwork rasterised at 2x, SVG is the artwork itself with every
 * custom property resolved to a real colour, and the share card is a 1200 x 630
 * PNG with the title printed above the diagram. targetRef points at the wrapper
 * around the figure rather than at the svg, and the menu finds the figure’s own
 * artwork inside it. title is what names the download, slugged — Request path
 * arrives as request-path.png.
