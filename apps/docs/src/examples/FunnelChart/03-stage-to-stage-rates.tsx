/**
 * Two labels on the same funnel: the stage's name inside it, and the share it
 * kept of the stage above it out to the right. The taper is a ratio the eye
 * reads as area, so it exaggerates a shallow drop and flattens a steep one, and
 * a printed rate is the only thing that makes the fall-off exact. The steepest
 * drop here is activations to paid, where barely a third carries through, and it
 * is the one the shape says least about because it happens where the funnel is
 * already narrow. Each rate is a share of the stage above it rather than of the
 * top, because those are two different numbers that look alike, and a funnel
 * that does not say which one it is printing gets read as whichever flatters
 * it.
