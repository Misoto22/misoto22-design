/**
 * The default funnel: four stages, widest first, each with its name printed beside
 * it. The taper encodes a ratio between neighbouring stages and the eye reads the
 * enclosed area, so a funnel exaggerates a shallow drop and flattens a steep one —
 * the printed label is the relief for that, and where the exact fall-off is the
 * point a BarChart puts every stage on one honest scale instead. Order is the
 * funnel and the data is never sorted for you, so the widest stage has to be
 * first.
