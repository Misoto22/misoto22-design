 * pos instead of row and col, which is what unlocks a hand-tuned route: via,
 * channelX and channelY are honoured only when BOTH ends of the connection were
 * placed absolutely. Between two grid components they are coordinates in a
 * space this renderer chose rather than the author, so they are dropped and the
 * line is re-routed without a word. Nothing detects a collision either — two
 * components given the same coordinate are drawn one plate over the other and
 * the figure renders, with the summary list beside it still reporting both.
