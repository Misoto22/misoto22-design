/**
 * The two boundary kinds, one nested inside the other. A region is a solid frame
 * around where something runs and a security-group is dashed around what may
 * reach it, so a reader who came for one of those two questions can tell which
 * frame answers it before reading either caption. The security variant marks the
 * single hop that crosses the dashed line, and the queue-to-worker arrow inside
 * it carries no wording at all — affordable only because exactly one arrow leaves
 * that box, and a guess the moment a second one does.
