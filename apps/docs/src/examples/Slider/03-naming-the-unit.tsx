 * format prints, and nothing more: it renders the readout above the track, and
 * nothing here sets aria-valuetext, so a thumb showing 12s announces the bare
 * number 12. The unit belongs in the name, which is announced — “Request
 * timeout in seconds”, read together with 12, is a fact, while “Timeout” read
 * with 12 is a riddle. The second slider carries no format at all, which is
 * what a plain count should look like.
