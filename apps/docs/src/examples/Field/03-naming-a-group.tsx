 * A Field around a RadioGroup draws the words and binds them to nothing: the
 * group's root is a div, and htmlFor only reaches a labelable element, so
 * clicking the label does nothing and the group would be announced with no name
 * at all. The same words go on the group as aria-label, and that is what a
 * screen reader actually reads. ToggleGroup needs the same treatment, and
 * Select, Combobox, DatePicker and Slider each take a required label of their
 * own for the same reason.
