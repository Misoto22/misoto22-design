/**
 * hint and error are the same line, and the error wins. Delete the @ and watch
 * the format disappear at the one moment a reader needed it — which is why the
 * error below repeats the shape of a good answer instead of only saying no.
 * Passing error is also all the invalid state this row needs: the field puts
 * aria-invalid on the input, and Input reads either spelling, so adding invalid
 * as well states one fact from two places that can disagree.
