 * The state every chart on a page is in on first paint. isLoading swaps the marks
 * for a skeleton and keeps the chart's measured height, so nothing on the page
 * moves when the rows land. The skeleton's rows are re-rolled as the shimmer
 * leaves the plot rather than on a timer, because an interval drifts against the
 * animation and eventually re-rolls them in full view, which reads as the chart
 * glitching rather than as it loading.
