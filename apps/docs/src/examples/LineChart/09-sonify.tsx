/**
 * Two series play one after the other, each introduced by name, rather than
 * together with one panned to each ear. Panning is the better demo and the worse
 * choice: it assumes a stereo output and two usable ears, so a mono speaker or a
 * single hearing aid collapses both runs into one melody the listener cannot
 * unpick, and it caps the feature at two series. Both are pitched against the
 * same range, exactly as they share one value axis on screen, so p50's flatness
 * low in the range is audible as flatness rather than renormalised into a second
 * dramatic line.
