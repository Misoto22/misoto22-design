 * Forty rows and two series, which is where a line chart starts crossing itself.
 * The strip is a miniature of the whole series with a lit window over the part
 * the plot above is showing, so the reader can see what they are choosing from
 * while they choose it. Its handles are positioned by inline style rather than by
 * start and end classes on purpose: a cartesian plot is drawn first row first in
 * every writing direction, so mirroring them under dir="rtl" would put the
 * earlier handle at the end of a chart that still runs the other way.
