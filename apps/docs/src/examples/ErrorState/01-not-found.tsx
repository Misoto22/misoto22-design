/**
 * The page that could not be shown. Render it instead of the page rather than
 * inside it: it is a full viewport with its own ground and its own top
 * clearance, so nested in a layout that already has a header it adds a second
 * screen of blank below the fold — the examples here pass min-h-0 to fit the
 * canvas, and level={2} because this page's own h1 sits above them. code sits
 * at the top of the type ladder and is aria-hidden, so the heading immediately
 * after has to say the same thing in words. There is no
 * live region either, so a route that swaps the whole screen for this changes
 * everything a sighted reader can see and says nothing at all.
