 * action is required rather than optional, because it is the only focusable
 * thing on the screen — and it has to point at a real destination rather than
 * at history. A reader arrives at an error page cold or from someone else's
 * link at least as often as they arrive from the app, so going back returns
 * them to the page that just failed, or to nothing. Two links are about the
 * most this should carry: the way home, and the page that says whether it is
 * only them.
