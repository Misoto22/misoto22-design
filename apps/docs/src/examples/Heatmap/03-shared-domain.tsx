/**
 * Two grids that only mean something read against each other, so both are pinned
 * to one domain. Derived, each would run from zero to its own largest reading and
 * both would use the full ramp — Frankfurt's three-minute peak would come out
 * exactly as dark as Sydney's ten-minute one, which is the single failure a shared
 * legend cannot fix. formatValue carries the unit into the cells: without it a
 * shift announces itself as 480, and with it as 8m, which is the difference
 * between a number and a reading for anyone reaching these cells through the table
 * rather than by eye.
