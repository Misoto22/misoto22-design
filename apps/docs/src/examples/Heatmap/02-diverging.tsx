/**
 * Diverging reads distance from the midpoint, so both directions darken and the
 * middle of the scale is the page itself — the scale for a delta, a residual,
 * anything whose zero is a real boundary rather than just the bottom. The domain
 * is pinned symmetrically on purpose: derived, it would run from the lowest
 * reading to the highest and leave the midpoint wherever the extremes happened to
 * fall rather than on the zero the scale hinges on. The week with no reading is
 * drawn as a dashed outline instead of the palest cell, because a gap is not a
 * zero, and showValues caps the wash at 35 percent of the ramp so a printed number
 * clears its own background on every cell.
