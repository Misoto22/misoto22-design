/**
 * The sequential scale, for a value that only ever goes up — a count, a duration,
 * a volume. The ramp is one hue, light to dark, because lightness is the only
 * channel whose order the eye reads without consulting a legend; spending hue on
 * magnitude is the perennial heatmap mistake, and there is no hue left here to get
 * wrong. The domain is derived from the cells, which is right for a grid read on
 * its own and wrong the moment a second grid is put beside it.
