/**
 * The case this exists for: a media grid whose covers have not arrived. Each
 * box is already the right height, so when the images land nothing under them
 * moves — and that movement is exactly what a Cumulative Layout Shift score is
 * measuring. The skeleton has no size of its own; it fills the box because
 * every direct child is stretched to it, which means the loading state and the
 * loaded state occupy the same rectangle by construction rather than by two
 * numbers someone kept in step.
