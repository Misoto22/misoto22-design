/**
 * What the box does when the content does not fit, which is the trade nobody
 * reads about until it bites. Every direct child is taken out of flow and the
 * wrapper hides its overflow, so content longer than the box is CLIPPED rather
 * than allowed to push the height — the ratio was the promise, and it is the
 * promise kept. Where the words have to be readable, give the child its own
 * scroll, as the second box does; where they do not, reach for a box that can
 * grow instead of one that cannot.
