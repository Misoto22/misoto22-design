 * rows sizes the box, maxLength caps it, and the hint says so. maxLength on its

 * character too long in silence, so the count below is not decoration — it is
 * the only warning a reader gets before the box stops accepting what they type.
 * Enter still means newline here, and should: a textarea that submits on Enter
 * has taken the one key the control exists to accept.
