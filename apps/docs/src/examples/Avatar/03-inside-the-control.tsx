 * An account control with the avatar inside it, rather than an onClick hung on
 * the circle. The root is a span nothing has made focusable and sm is 28px,
 * under the 44px pointer floor — so an avatar wired up as a menu trigger is
 * unreachable by keyboard and undersized at once. The button brings the target,
 * the focus ring and the accessible name; the circle stays a picture.
