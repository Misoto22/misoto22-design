/**
 * A map is only worth drawing when the frame is smaller than the artwork, so
 * frame carries the canvas’s own box in CSS pixels and content the figure at its
 * natural size. The rectangle is derived from the canvas’s view on every change
 * rather than stored, which is why the two can never come to disagree. Clicking
 * or dragging on the map reports a point in the artwork’s coordinates and
 * centerOn does the moving — the minimap has no authority over the view, it only
 * says where the reader pointed.
