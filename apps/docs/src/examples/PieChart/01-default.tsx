/**
 * The default composition — wedges, a hover panel and a key. A pie is read by
 * angle, the least precise encoding on offer, so it answers roughly what share
 * and nothing more precise: ranking 275 against 200 by eye is unreliable, and
 * past about five wedges, which is exactly this many, a BarChart answers the
 * same question better. The legend is not decoration here, since a pie has no
 * category axis and nothing else names the sectors; the figure also ships a
 * hidden table of the same rows, which is where the exact numbers live.
