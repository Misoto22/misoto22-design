/**
 * The control says what it does on the page; the tip only adds the shortcut. A
 * tooltip is unreachable on touch, invisible to anyone scanning, and dismissed
 * the moment focus leaves — so nothing a reader NEEDS can live only in one. Two
 * more limits worth knowing: the tip is capped at 16rem in 11px mono, so a
 * sentence wraps into a five-line block that covers the thing it describes; and
 * nothing focusable belongs inside content, because the tip is not in the tab
 * order and closes when the trigger loses focus. A link or a button in there is
 * reachable by pointer and by nothing else. That is a Popover.
