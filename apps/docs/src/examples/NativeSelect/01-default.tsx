 * The platform's own picker, restyled as far as it can be: appearance-none
 * drops the operating system's arrow and the chevron beside it is ours, so it
 * does not flip or move when the list opens. What it cannot do is look like the
 * system once open — the options are drawn by the OS and carry none of these
 * tokens, which is why this is the escape hatch and Select is the default.
 * Reach for it where the platform genuinely wins: a very long list on a phone,
 * a form that must work without JavaScript, a page counting its last kilobyte.
