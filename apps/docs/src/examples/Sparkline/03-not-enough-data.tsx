/**
 * What a sparkline does when there is no shape to draw. Under two points it
 * prints its own label followed by "not enough data" instead of a mark: one
 * reading is not a trend, and normalising a single value against itself puts a
 * dot wherever the arithmetic lands, which a reader would take for a
 * measurement. It is the state a new project is in on its first day and the
 * state a narrow filter reaches constantly, so it is worth knowing what it looks
 * like before it turns up forty rows down a table.
