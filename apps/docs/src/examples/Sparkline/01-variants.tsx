/**
 * The three marks the same run can be drawn with: line reads a trend, area weights
 * that trend toward volume, and bars separate the readings, which is what a
 * discrete count wants. All three are axis-less, gridless and label-less by
 * design — every piece of chrome that would let one answer "what value exactly"
 * also makes it too big to sit inline, which was the only reason to reach for it.
 * The exact figure is printed beside the run by value instead, and on line and
 * area the last point is dotted, since that is usually the one being asked
 * about.
