/**
 * A column of sparklines, every one of them pinned to the same domain. That is the
 * whole lesson: on domains derived per row, each run peaks and troughs at the same
 * heights, so a channel that halved and a channel that doubled draw the same
 * picture — the single way a table of sparklines becomes actively misleading. Each
 * run also carries its own label, because a screen reader meets four of these in
 * four cells and nothing else in the row names them.
