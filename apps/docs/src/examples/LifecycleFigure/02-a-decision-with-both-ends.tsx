/**
 * A decision with both of its ends drawn. Approved sits on the rail, so its
 * arrow is implied; Declined sits in a second lane, which is the only way to fan
 * out of a decision here — a fourth state added to the first lane would be joined
 * to its neighbour by the implied rail whether that transition exists or not.
 * The two terminal states are the only marks in the package allowed colour, and
 * this is the figure the tokens were reserved for: the question a reader brings
 * to a state machine is which end a run came out of.
