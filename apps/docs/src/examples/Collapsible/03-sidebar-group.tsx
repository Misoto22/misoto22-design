/**
 * Controlled, because something outside has to be able to open it: the group
 * holding the current route must already be expanded when the reader arrives,
 * and a component that owns its own state cannot be told that. Do not build a
 * set out of these — two sections cannot close each other, so the reader ends
 * with every group open and a column to scroll past. That coordination is the
 * whole of what an accordion's single value buys, and it is the reason to
 * reach for one instead once there are three groups.
