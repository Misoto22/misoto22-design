 * Resting, invalid, disabled. invalid paints the border with --danger and sets
 * aria-invalid, and that is all it does — the border says something is wrong
 * and never what, so an invalid input outside a Field with an error message is
 * a red box with no reason attached. Each of these carries aria-label because
 * it stands alone here; in a form that is Field's job, and a placeholder is
 * never the name because it leaves the moment anyone types.
