/**
 * The same idea locked two ways. readOnly keeps the field in the tab order and
 * in the submitted form data; disabled takes it out of both, so the server
 * hears nothing about a field the reader can plainly see — reach for readOnly
 * whenever the value is real but not editable. Nothing styles readOnly here:
 * the control dims on :disabled only, so a read-only field is pixel-identical
 * to an editable one and the hint has to say so. A Tooltip cannot fill that gap
 * on the disabled row either, because a disabled input receives no hover.
