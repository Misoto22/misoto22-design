 * The one control on this base that does not read aria-invalid. Field's error
 * paints Input, Textarea and NativeSelect on its own, because all three read
 * either spelling — the Select trigger looks only at invalid, so a row given
 * the error and nothing else ends up with a red message under a resting border.
 * Pass both. Note the placeholder rather than a defaultValue: a select that
 * opens already answered is one nobody has actually answered.
