/**
 * A bulk-action bar, and the reason the role is group rather than toolbar. The
 * ARIA toolbar contract is a single tab stop with the arrow keys moving between
 * the controls inside it; this implements no roving tabindex, so declaring that
 * role would tell a screen-reader user to press keys that do nothing. As a
 * named group every control keeps its own place in the tab order — Tab reaches
 * Archive, then Delete, then Clear — and the bar is still announced by name,
 * which is why label is required rather than optional.
