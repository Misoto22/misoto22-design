 * The one place lead belongs: the standfirst that carries a piece, directly
 * under its title. It is --fs-item, the bottom rung of the heading ladder, and
 * the ladder is where it stops — a paragraph larger than a record title is a
 * heading that has not admitted it, and a p at that size is invisible to the
 * heading list a screen reader navigates by. The gaps here come from the
 * column, because every Text is margin: 0.
