 * One accented plate, which is the whole budget: accent is the system's only
 * fill, so a figure with three of them is a figure about nothing. footnote
 * prints under the box and outside it, for the sentence a note is too short to
 * hold. This spec has no caption, so label is what names the figure's group —
 * with neither, a screen reader announces a group and never says what of.
