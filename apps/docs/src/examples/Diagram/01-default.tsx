 * A request, drawn as three ranks with the work nested inside the middle one.
 * Only the nodes an edge names carry an id, and each edge is written in the
 * order the array runs: an edge is matched against the node immediately before
 * this one, so one written to-from, or between two nodes that are not
 * neighbours, draws nothing and reports nothing. The caption names the figure
 * for a screen reader as well as for a reader.
