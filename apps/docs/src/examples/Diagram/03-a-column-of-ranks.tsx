/**
 * The same machinery turned on its side. spec.direction stacks the top rank and
 * the arrows turn with it, which is also what a row does on its own below the
 * sm breakpoint — so a row of six plates that reads as a pipeline on a desktop
 * is six stacked boxes and five arrows on a phone. A child rank keeps its own
 * axis: direction is read from the node that HAS children and never inherits
 * from the rank above, which is why the three stores below still sit in a row.
