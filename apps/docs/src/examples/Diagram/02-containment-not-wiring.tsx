/**
 * Structure with no flow in it: no edges, just nesting. A node WITH children is
 * drawn as a labelled hairline band and a node without is a plate, which is
 * what keeps a figure three levels deep from carrying three borders around
 * anything inside it. That also means accent paints only on a plate — set on a
 * container it compiles, type-checks and shows nothing, because a band has no
 * fill to take.
