/**
 * Box, name, and the line that says what saying yes actually costs — all three
 * inside the label, so the whole row is the click target rather than an 18px
 * square, and the sentence is part of the accessible name. That is the argument
 * for putting the detail inside rather than beside it, and also the reason to
 * keep it to one clause: it is read out every time the row is. The rows align
 * on their first line, because a box centred against two lines of text floats
 * away from the word it belongs to. These commit when the form is saved; a
 * setting that applies on the spot is a Switch.
