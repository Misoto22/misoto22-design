/**
 * Summaries that arrived already computed, which is the other shape this takes
 * — a warehouse hands back percentiles, never rows. count is what a notch
 * needs: the pinch is 1.58 times IQR over the square root of n, so two notches
 * that do not overlap are roughly a 95 percent test that those medians differ,
 * and Variant B's notch is wide because its sample is 190 against the others'
 * 4,000. That is the comparison the plain box hides, since a box over 190
 * readings and a box over 4,200 are drawn identically. The notch is clamped to
 * the quartiles rather than allowed to fold the box inside out, so a sample too
 * small for the comparison pinches to a sliver instead of reading as a
 * rendering fault.
