/**
 * Four distributions in the ink four bars would take, handed over as raw
 * observations — the chart sorts them, takes quartiles the R type 7 way, and
 * stops each whisker at the most extreme reading still inside Tukey's 1.5 IQR
 * fence, so Sydney's 402 and Frankfurt's 588 fall out as dots rather than
 * stretching a whisker to a value nobody measured. What five numbers cannot
 * tell you is shape: a region with two humps in it draws the same box as a
 * smooth one centred in the same place. They cannot tell you sample size
 * either, since a box over ten readings and a box over ten thousand are drawn
 * identically — which is what count and BoxPlot.Boxes notch exist to fix. The
 * value axis is not anchored at zero, because dragging it there to be honest
 * about bar length would flatten every box into one band of pixels.
