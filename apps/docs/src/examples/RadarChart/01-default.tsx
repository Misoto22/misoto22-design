/**
 * One profile across six named dimensions: what a radar offers is a silhouette
 * to recognise, not magnitudes to compare. Two consequences follow from the
 * geometry and neither is a matter of taste — doubling every value quadruples
 * the area the polygon encloses, so the fill overstates the difference it
 * appears to show, and reordering the spokes redraws the same six numbers as a
 * different shape, which makes the axis order a choice the chart cannot label.
 * Dot variant border marks each vertex, which is where the values actually are;
 * the edges between them are interpolation rather than data.
