/**
 * A third measure on the same two axes, carried by ZAxis. Recharts scales the z
 * range in AREA units, which is what makes it safe: map a value to a RADIUS
 * instead and doubling it quadruples the ink, so a release with twice the
 * downloads would read as four times as popular. The 60 to 900 range here is a
 * fifteenfold span of area and roughly a fourfold span of diameter. outline is
 * deliberate too — bubbles overlap by construction, and a solid mark hides
 * whatever smaller one it lands on.
