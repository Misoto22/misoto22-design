/**
 * Two measures against each other, one mark per observation — the only chart
 * here whose x axis is a NUMBER rather than a category, which is what lets it
 * answer correlation, clustering and outliers. Seven points rising together is
 * a pattern and not a coefficient: nothing here fits a line, and the chart
 * claims no share of ms explained by kB. Each solid mark carries a
 * surface-coloured ring, the hairline that keeps two overlapping observations
 * countable — past a few hundred points that stops working and density has to
 * be shown some other way. The table prop is not bookkeeping: a scatter's rows
 * live on each Scatter rather than on the root, so unlike every other chart in
 * the package the hidden table cannot be inferred and has to be declared.
