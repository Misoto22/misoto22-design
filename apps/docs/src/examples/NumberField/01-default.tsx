/**
 * The grip at the start of each field is the reason to reach for this rather
 * than an Input: drag it and the value sweeps through its neighbours, one step
 * every few pixels, ten steps at a time with Shift held. That is how a line
 * height or a radius is actually found — by passing through the wrong answers
 * until one looks right, not by typing candidates one at a time. The arrows do
 * the same journey from the keyboard, which is why the grip is not announced.
