 * The range is applied when the field is left, not on every keystroke. It has
 * to be: with a minimum of 10, clamping as you type makes 50 unreachable — the
 * 5 is pushed up to 10 before the 0 arrives. So the live figure below can sit
 * outside the range for as long as somebody is mid-number, and the value that
 * settles never does. Type 4, then tab away.
