 * nowhere. The separators sit in their own aria-hidden list items, so the trail
 * is read as its items rather than as home slash components slash. label names
 * the nav landmark; a page that can hold two trails has to name both, or a
 * reader gets two entries called Breadcrumb and no way to choose.
