/**
 * The trail above the title it ends on. Start it above the current page: a
 * one-item Breadcrumb renders that item as the current crumb with no path at
 * all, which is a landmark announcing a journey of length one. Every crumb but
 * the last needs an href — one without renders as plain text in the same colour
 * as the links beside it, with no destination and no aria-current, so it reads
 * as the page the reader is on when it is not. The last crumb repeating the
 * heading is not a duplication to fix: one is the path, the other is the page.
