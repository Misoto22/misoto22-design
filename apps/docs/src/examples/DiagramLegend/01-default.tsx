/**
 * Two of the sets the renderers build for themselves. kindLegend draws each
 * sigil with the same component the plates draw it with, and labels it with the
 * same word the plate’s eyebrow prints, so a key and the figure above it cannot
 * drift apart; stateLegend draws each state as the plate itself, colour and dash
 * included. title defaults to Key, which is why the second one is renamed — two
 * keys stacked in a column and both headed Key say nothing about which is which.
