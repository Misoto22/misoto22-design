/**
 * sample is markup on a 14 by 14 grid rather than a name matched against a fixed
 * list, which is what lets a figure that draws a mark of its own document it —
 * here, three states of ownership that no renderer knows about. Whatever goes in
 * has to be the same mark the artwork drew: a key that invents a form sends a
 * reader looking through the picture for something that was never there. Paint
 * the samples with the diagram tokens rather than with fixed colours, so the key
 * follows the figure into dark mode and onto paper.
