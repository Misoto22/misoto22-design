/**
 * Eight named parts, and the name gives away none of them. The frame is a grid
 * and nothing else — a 15rem sidebar beside a 1fr column from md up, one column
 * below that. The sidebar is a complementary landmark named by sidebarLabel; on
 * a phone it becomes a drawer that slides in from the edge reading STARTS at.
 * Inside it, brand sits in a 3.5rem row above a hairline — the same height as
 * the topbar, so the two rules meet across the column boundary — and the nav is
 * the part that scrolls. The topbar is sticky and rendered whether or not you
 * pass one, so a shell with nothing to put up there still costs 3.5rem and a
 * rule. The toggle and the scrim are phone-only, and openLabel and closeLabel
 * are the toggle's entire accessible name. Last is the content well, centred at
 * the page measure with the page padding already applied.
