 * The closing bar says where the total landed; it does not say whether that was
 * where the plan said it would. A reference line draws that one number across
 * the cascade, above the bars rather than behind them — a target a bar covers is
 * a target nobody can check — and it extends the axis to fit rather than being
 * discarded, which is what makes it visible here, since the plan sits above
 * every bar in the chart. weight firm is solid ink, for the one threshold a
 * chart is actually about; the quiet default is a dashed hairline, for context
 * that has to be present and clearly not data.
