/**
 * An opening total, four signed contributions, and a closing bar that carries no
 * value of its own: it is whatever the deltas add up to, so it can never disagree
 * with the steps above it. Decreases take the 45 degree hatch and increases the
 * solid fill — texture rather than a second colour, so the reading survives
 * greyscale and forced colours — and a total is told from an increase by geometry,
 * since it is the only kind of bar standing on the baseline. The steps here are
 * simultaneous and their order is editorial, which is what the description says
 * out loud: the arithmetic survives any order, but the connectors draw a sequence
 * and a reader will take the leftmost bar as the first cause.
