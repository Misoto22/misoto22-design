/**
 * An FAQ: type single with collapsible, so the row the reader opened can be
 * closed again. Without collapsible there is no empty value to return to, and
 * the first row they open is a row they can never close. The marker is a plus
 * rather than a chevron, deliberately — a plus says this opens, a chevron says
 * there is more below, and in a stack of rows that decides whether the reader
 * expects expansion or navigation. Key each row by something stable rather than
 * by its position: Radix tracks the open one by value, so filtering or
 * re-ordering the list leaves whatever now sits in that slot standing open.

        No. The compiled stylesheet is self-contained. If you already compile Tailwind, import the token
