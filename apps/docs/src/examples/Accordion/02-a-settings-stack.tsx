 * type multiple, because these two rows have to be read against each other —
 * single closes the one the reader was holding in order to open the one they
 * wanted to compare it with. defaultValue opens the group they came for. The
 * panel is overflow-hidden, which is what lets its measured height animate, so
 * anything inside that has to escape the row's box — a select's menu, a
 * popover — must portal out of it or be cut off at the row's edge.
