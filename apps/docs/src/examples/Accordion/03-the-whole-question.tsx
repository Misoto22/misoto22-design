 * title is the accessible name of the panel as well as of the trigger, so a row
 * called More opens a region called More — and a reader moving between regions
 * gets a list of them that names nothing. Write the whole question. The rows on
 * the right say what is behind them before they are opened, which is also what
 * makes the closed stack readable: a column of one-word triggers is a table of
 * contents for a book with no chapter titles.
