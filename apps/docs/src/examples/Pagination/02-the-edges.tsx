/**
 * The same twenty-four pages seen from both ends and from the middle, which is
 * where a pager is usually wrong. Previous is disabled at page one and Next at
 * the last, which takes each out of the tab order rather than leaving a control
 * that does nothing when pressed. The ellipsis appears only where the sequence
 * skips more than one page — a single skipped page is printed instead, because
 * 1 … 3 is longer than 1 2 3 and tells the reader less. Three pagers means
 * three nav landmarks, so each one here is named.
