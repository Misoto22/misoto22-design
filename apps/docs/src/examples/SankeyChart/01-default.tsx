/**
 * The only chart here whose data is a GRAPH rather than a table: it takes nodes
 * and links, and each link names its ends by index into that node array. Width
 * is quantity and a node is drawn as tall as the flows through it, so a link
 * the data leaves out quietly shrinks the node it should have fed — and a flow
 * that returns to a stage it already left has no left-to-right reading at all.
 * The hidden table lists the FLOWS rather than the nodes for the same reason: a
 * table of node totals loses every from-to the diagram exists to state.
 * NodeLabel with showValues prints the number beside each name, because a
 * band's width is no easier to measure by eye than a wedge's angle.
