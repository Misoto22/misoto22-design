/**
 * The skeleton, and the one in this set that ignores its data: while isLoading
 * is set the diagram is replaced by a fixed eight-node, eleven-link graph, so
 * the shape reads as a sankey before anything has arrived and the data prop
 * only has to satisfy the type. Nodes and links pulse out of phase rather than
 * together, which is what keeps a skeleton from reading as one blinking block;
 * under prefers-reduced-motion they hold at fixed opacities instead. Node and
 * Link are slots the root reads, so composing them costs nothing here and is
 * what makes the diagram come back as itself when the graph lands.
