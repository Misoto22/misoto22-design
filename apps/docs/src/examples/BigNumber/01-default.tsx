/**
 * Three deltas, each with its direction stated by the call site rather than
 * inferred from the sign: errors down 12 percent is good news and revenue down 12
 * percent is not, and no component can tell which one it is holding, so intent is
 * what decides whether a change is tinted ok or danger. The arrow and the
 * screen-reader word carry that same reading, which is what keeps it legible in
 * greyscale, under forced colours, and to a reader who cannot separate the two
 * tints. A delta of zero is flat — a sideways arrow and no tint at all — which is
 * why a neutral intent still has something to say.
