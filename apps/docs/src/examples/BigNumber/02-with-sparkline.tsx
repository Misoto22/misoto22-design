/**
 * The pairing every dashboard reaches for: the number answers how much, and the
 * run beneath it answers how it got there, without spending a whole panel on an
 * axis nobody reads off. children is where that run goes, under the label, the
 * number and the delta; the sparkline takes a label of its own because the heading
 * above it names a different fact. Reach for a LineChart the moment the shape has
 * to be read precisely — a sparkline has no axis to read it against, by design.
