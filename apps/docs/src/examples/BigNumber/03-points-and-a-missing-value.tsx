/**
 * Two things this component refuses to guess. The default delta format is a
 * signed percentage, so 0.6 would print as plus 60 percent — right for a ratio
 * and wrong for a rate that is already a percentage, where the change is 0.6
 * percentage points; format is how a call site says which of the two it is
 * holding. The second card has no figure yet and no delta at all: value takes a
 * node rather than a number precisely so the call site can print an em dash
 * there, because a zero would be a claim and a change against nothing has no
 * direction to point in.
