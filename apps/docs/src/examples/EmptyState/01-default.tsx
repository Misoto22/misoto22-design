/**
 * A collection that is new, and the one thing to do next. The copy says what to
 * do rather than what failed, which is the whole difference from ErrorState and
 * the reason they are two components rather than one with a variant. The frame
 * carries no role and no live region, so replacing a SkeletonPage with this
 * removes the region that said Loading projects and puts nothing in its place —
 * announce the arrival yourself. title opens a heading at level 2, which is
 * right directly under a page's h1; inside a section that already has its own
 * h2, pass level={3} rather than leaving a hole in heading navigation.
