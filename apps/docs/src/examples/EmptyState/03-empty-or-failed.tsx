/**
 * Nothing here yet, against something went wrong. The pair is asymmetric, which
 * is why the distinction matters: a reader told a request failed retries, but a
 * reader told a collection is empty acts on it — creating the record they
 * already have, or reporting a data loss that never happened. So when the
 * request errored, say so, even on the day the list would have been empty
 * anyway. Both are view-sized in real use — the error side is a full viewport
 * and the empty side carries 160px of vertical padding; each is shortened here
 * to share one canvas.
