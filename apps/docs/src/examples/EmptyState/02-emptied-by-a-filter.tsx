 * The same component, saying which kind of empty this is. No projects yet shown
 * over an active filter tells the reader their projects are gone, and the
 * recovery from that belief costs more than the sentence would have — so name
 * the filters that are on, say what clearing them brings back, and make the
 * action the way out of the state rather than a second way in. description is
 * capped at 24rem and centred, so it stays a sentence: longer copy becomes a
 * narrow ragged column the eye returns from before the part that mattered.
