/**
 * Three things are allowed out of the 46rem measure, because they are unreadable
 * inside it: a figure, a table, and anything the pipeline marks m22-wide. A
 * table has nothing of its own to scroll in, so six columns push the whole PAGE
 * sideways unless the table is wrapped in m22-table-scroll — have the pipeline
 * do that wrapping rather than hoping the content stays narrow. Drag the table
 * below sideways and the column around it stays put. Note the heading depth
 * too: h5 and h6 are set as mono eyebrows rather than as smaller headings, so a
 * document that nests six levels loses its hierarchy at exactly the depth that
 * needed one.

        The table is wider than the column it sits in, which is the point: it
        scrolls inside its own wrapper instead of taking the page with it.
