/**
 * The whole reading surface, styled from element selectors rather than from
 * classes — because the input is usually not JSX but a string from a Markdown
 * pipeline, and there is no component to hang a class on. Two things to know
 * before using it. The rhythm is a direct-child combinator, so a div wrapped
 * around a run of paragraphs, even a display:contents one, costs all of them
 * their spacing. And it sets a MEASURE, not a layout: with no auto margins of
 * its own it sits against the start edge of a wide page until a parent centres
 * it. The standfirst is marked by the author with p.lead, never inferred, since
 * a stylesheet that promotes whatever came first gets it wrong the moment a
 * post opens on an image.
