 * A control in flight, a control that is off, and a control advertising a
 * shortcut. Reach for loading rather than swapping the label by hand: it holds
 * the label, sets aria-busy and blocks the click in one move, so the box does
 * not collapse under the pointer that just hit it. The keycap is real text and
 * joins the accessible name, so write one only where a key is actually bound.
