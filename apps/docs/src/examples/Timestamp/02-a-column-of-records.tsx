/**
 * The real use, and the reason the component exists rather than a call to
 * toLocaleString at each site. auto is doing the work down this column: the
 * recent rows read as a relative gap and the older ones as calendar dates, and
 * the switch happens at a week, because past that the date is both the more
 * useful fact and the one that stops changing. It formats once per mount — a hundred
 * rows each holding a ticking interval to keep three hours ago honest is a cost
 * nobody asked for, so a list that must tick re-renders from above.
