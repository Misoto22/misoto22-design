 * The same instant three times, beside the string every one of them is built
 * from. This page is statically exported, so the first paint — the one the
 * build produces and the browser has to reproduce exactly while hydrating — is
 * the UTC calendar date sliced straight out of that string, with no Intl
 * anywhere near it: both sides compute it from the same characters, so they
 * cannot disagree. The locale-aware and relative forms are applied after mount,
 * where there is a reader to be local to. The datetime attribute is the full
 * instant from the first render onwards and never changes, which is what a
 * screen reader or a crawler reads whether or not the effect has run.
