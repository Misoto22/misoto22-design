 * A log, not a command — copyable={false} is for the block nobody is meant to
 * run, and this is the case it exists for. Everywhere else the button stays:
 * dropping it to tidy the strip takes away the reason a reader stops selecting
 * a wrapped command by hand. With no title, no language and no copy button
 * there is nothing to put in the strip, so there is no strip — and the
 * scrolling body still needs a name, which is what label is for.
