/**
 * The smallest useful block: one line, a language, and the copy button. The
 * strip is not a hover affordance and never has been — a control that appears
 * on hover does not exist on a touch screen, which is exactly where a reader is
 * least able to select a wrapped command by hand. What it copies is the code
 * string, so nothing about the rendering can end up on the clipboard.
 *
 * `label` rather than `title`, because the block stays bare: the name is for
 * the scroll region, not for a header strip. Two blocks side by side both fall
 * back to "Code" without it, and two regions sharing one name are two landmarks
 * a reader cannot tell apart.
