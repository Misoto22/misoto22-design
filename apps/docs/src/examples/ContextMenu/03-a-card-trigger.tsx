/**
 * asChild hands Radix the Card itself. Without it Radix inserts a span between
 * the trigger and the child, and that span becomes the grid item while the card
 * is laid out inside it as inline content — a layout that looks broken for a
 * reason nothing on the page points at. The menu is modal, so the page behind
 * is scroll-locked and pointer-inert while it is open: right for a short list
 * of actions on one object, wrong for anything the reader has to scroll the
 * page to answer.
