 * The state a status page is in on the morning nobody has filled it in — a new
 * quarter, a filter that matches nothing, an account with no history — and the
 * one most chart libraries hand back as a stack of empty tracks, which a reader
 * cannot tell apart from a chart that failed to load. The figure keeps its title
 * and its description either way, so the page still says what is missing. The
 * copy names what happened rather than saying "no data", and it carries the one
 * thing that changes it: an empty state without an action is a dead end.
