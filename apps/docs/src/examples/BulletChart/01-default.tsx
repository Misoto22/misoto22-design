/**
 * Four measures on one shared 0 to 100 scale, so the bands mean the same thing on
 * every row and the rows can be compared with each other as well as each against
 * its own target. The bar is the measurement and the rule across it is the target:
 * two different kinds of number, which is why the target is not drawn as a second
 * bar beside it. The bands are a judgement someone made, drawn in the same ink as
 * the measurement, and they compress — a value clearing a boundary by a point sits
 * in the same band as one clearing it by thirty, so a band answers whether a
 * number is acceptable and never by how much. No rendering engine and no state:
 * each row is one linear scale laid out as plain HTML with logical properties,
 * which is server-renderable and mirrors correctly in a right-to-left document
 * where an SVG drawn in user space would not.
