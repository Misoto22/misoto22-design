 * Four measures sharing no unit and no range, each carrying its own domain and its

 * scale, so the chart-level ranges and domain are left off entirely here. showScale
 * is off by default and the toggle turns it on, because with four different
 * domains stacked up a reader has no other way to learn what either end of a track
