/**
 * A figure wider than the room it is given, in a frame that can be moved around
 * it. A drag pans, the plate in the corner zooms, and the percentage between its
 * two buttons is the reset; a plain wheel is deliberately left to the page, so
 * only Command or Control with the wheel zooms. The frame is a real tab stop, so
 * plus, minus, zero and the arrow keys do the same work with no pointer at all.
 * The figure’s own heading, key and cards are turned off here because the canvas
 * is holding artwork, not an article.
