/**
 * Three ways to hide the same sentence, and the same consequence in all three:
 * what is closed is unmounted rather than hidden, so find-in-page cannot reach
 * it, a print takes only what happened to be open, and none of the three writes
 * the open one into the URL. Choose by what the reader is doing. Tabs are
 * mutually exclusive views of one subject and cost the reader whatever was
 * typed into the panel they leave. An Accordion is a set that can coordinate —
 * type multiple lets two rows be read against each other, and every row adds an
 * h3 to the outline. A Collapsible is one disclosure with nothing to coordinate
 * with, and it adds no heading at all. Anything that has to be searchable or
 * printable belongs in the page, uncovered.
