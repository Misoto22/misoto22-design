/**
 * Eight packages as one partition of a whole. A treemap encodes value as area,
 * which the eye reads worse than length and far better than angle, and it is the
 * only form here that stays readable at fifty items. Two rules keep it honest: no
 * negative values, because an area cannot be negative, and the tiles have to sum
 * to something the reader recognises as the whole — under a dozen items with a
 * ranking to read, a BarChart is the more precise encoding, since a treemap
 * deliberately does not order its tiles by value alone.
