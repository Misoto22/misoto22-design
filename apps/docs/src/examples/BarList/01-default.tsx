/**
 * The ranked list at its plainest: eight rows, with the bar drawn behind the name
 * rather than beside it. That is the thing a horizontal bar chart cannot do — it
 * spends a third of its width on a category axis, and matching a name on that axis
 * to its bar is two steps where reading the name off the bar is none. Rows are
 * sorted descending unless sort says otherwise, and the scale's ceiling comes from
 * the largest of them, so this list is readable on its own but not against a
 * second one.
