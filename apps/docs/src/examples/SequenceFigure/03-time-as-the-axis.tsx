/**
 * What an explicit y buys. The first three calls sit 12 units apart because they
 * left the gateway together, and the vendor reply is 186 units below its call
 * because that is how long it took — placed from an index instead, the six
 * messages would space evenly and that difference would be gone. The activation
 * bars carry the same fact a second way: two close early while the third runs to
 * the bottom of the figure, which is the tail, visible before anyone reads a
 * label.
