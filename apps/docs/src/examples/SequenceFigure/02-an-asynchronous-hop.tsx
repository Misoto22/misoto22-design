/**
 * The asynchronous half of a delivery. The enqueue is dashed because Billing
 * does not wait for it — Billing has no activation bar at all, which is what
 * says the two attempts that follow cost the caller nothing. Both calls out
 * carry the security variant, which the key reads as crossing a trust boundary,
 * and it is true here: the endpoint belongs to the customer. column_fit is
 * spread because Partner webhook endpoint does not fit the fixed 148-unit
 * column, and shortening the name to make it fit would be a different diagram.
