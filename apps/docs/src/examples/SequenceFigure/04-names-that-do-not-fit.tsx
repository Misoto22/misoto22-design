/**
 * column_fit spread, which widens every column to the widest participant name
 * instead of holding the fixed one. Reach for it the moment a real name would
 * be clipped: the plate wraps to two lines and ellipsises the rest, and
 * shortening the name to make it fit is not a repair — the name is the data,
 * and dealer-portal-api is a different service from the api. A message naming a
 * participant that participants does not declare is not drawn at all, because
 * there is no column to draw it between; it stays in the summary list as the
 * raw id, so the text reports a call the picture does not show.
