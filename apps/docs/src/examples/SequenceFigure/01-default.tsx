 * A cache miss read down the page, where the vertical axis is time rather than
 * layout: the 50 units between the miss and the query are a real gap, and an
 * evenly spaced list of six calls would have erased it while looking tidier. The
 * activation bars carry the fact a list of calls cannot — Redis is busy for 45
 * units inside the 210 the API spends open. Returns are dashed and take an open
 * head, two signals rather than one, because the reply is what a reader picks out
 * of a dense trace first.
