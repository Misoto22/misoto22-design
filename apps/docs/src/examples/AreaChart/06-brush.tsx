/**
 * Thirty-two days is past what one plot can show at once, and a brush is the
 * answer that keeps the whole series visible while the reader picks a slice of
 * it. It is a child rather than a showBrush prop, and both handles are real
 * slider controls: tab to one and the arrow keys step it, Home and End jump it to
 * the ends, where the shape this was ported from was pointer-only. The cost is a
 * second miniature plot under the chart and the height it takes, so a chart of
 * six rows does not want one.
