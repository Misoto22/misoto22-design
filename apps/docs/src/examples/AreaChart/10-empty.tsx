/**
 * The other state a real dashboard reaches within a week — a filter that matches
 * nothing — and the one worth writing a sentence for, because an empty pair of
 * axes is indistinguishable from a chart that failed to load, so the reader
 * reloads the page and it is still empty. Distinct from the loading skeleton:
 * that one says "not yet", this one says "there is nothing here", and it usually
 * has something to do next attached. Pass empty={false} instead to keep the bare
 * axes, for a chart whose emptiness is itself the reading.
