/**
 * One of the two states a real dashboard chart spends most of its life in, and
 * the one that says "not yet" rather than "there is nothing here". The skeleton's
 * rows are seeded from the row index rather than drawn from Math.random, so the
 * server and the client render the same shape and a loading chart does not log a
 * hydration mismatch — and it keeps the chart's measured height, so the page does
 * not jump when the data lands. Under prefers-reduced-motion the travelling
 * highlight is replaced by a flat wash.
