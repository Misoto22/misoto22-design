/**
 * A panel dropped into a page that already has its h1. The outline decides
 * level — this opens a section, so it is an h2 and its sub-heads are h3s — and
 * size decides how big it looks, which is the whole reason they are two props.
 * Raising level to reach the larger step would give the page two first-level
 * headings and an outline nobody can navigate, for a difference one prop
 * already covers.
