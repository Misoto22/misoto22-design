/**
 * The two decisions, apart. level is the document outline — what a screen
 * reader navigates by — and size is the page. The default binds them through
 * the system ladder, which SKIPS a step between the first two: --fs-lead over
 * --fs-heading is a ratio of 1.14 and reads as an accident, where --fs-title
 * over --fs-heading is 1.86 and reads as a hierarchy. The mono eyebrow is the
 * ladder's fifth rung, worn here by an h4 so this run does not skip a level in
 * the outline; the last pair is a semantically-correct h3 that had to look
 * like a page title.
