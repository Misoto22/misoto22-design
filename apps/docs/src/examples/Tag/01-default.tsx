 * A facet row with one facet chosen. The accent fill is the system's one

 * active spends the mark that means "this one" on all of them. Nothing here is
 * clickable: without onRemove a Tag is a plain span, and the button, the focus
 * ring and the aria-pressed that makes the selection audible belong at the call
 * site, as the next example shows.
