 * The removable form: a chip for something the reader has already chosen. This
 * is where a separate Token component would have gone, and the difference
 * between the two is one prop rather than one component. removeLabel is
 * required alongside onRemove rather than defaulting to "Remove", because eight
 * controls all called Remove are eight controls a screen reader cannot tell
 * apart — name the subject in it.
