/**
 * The three chips that look nearly identical, on the one record where each is
 * the right answer. A Tag names what the record is ABOUT, so several sit
 * together and get scanned; a Badge is one fact about one record, which is why
 * it carries the status tones and a tag carries none; a StatusPill is the live
 * state of the view itself, at most one, in the loudest small type the system
 * has. Reach for the tag when you would want a second one beside it.
