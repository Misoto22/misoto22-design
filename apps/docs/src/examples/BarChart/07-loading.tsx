 * The skeleton, with its bar count set by hand. loadingBars decides how many bars
 * are drawn and otherwise defaults to twelve, which matters more on a bar chart
 * than on a line: a skeleton of twelve followed by six real bars reads as the
 * chart having lost half its data. The marks are swapped but the measured height
 * is kept, and a brush or a toolbar composed alongside is suppressed while this
 * is on, because there is nothing yet to choose a window from.
