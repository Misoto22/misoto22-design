Every icon in src/components is written as size={16} strokeWidth={1.5} in TSX, because the size lands on the SVG as an attribute rather than as a style. So the tokens are what a review checks against, and the numbers are what you will find in the source. Do not go looking for the var() that wires them together; there isn’t one.',
      'An icon aligns by flex, never by baseline. Button sets inline-flex items-center gap-(--control-gap) on every variant, so the glyph centres against its label and the gap comes off the density axis rather than off a margin written at the call site. Centring is right on a line of text and wrong against a block of it: Alert’s tone mark sits beside a title and a paragraph, so it takes mt-px shrink-0 instead. shrink-0 is on most icons in the package and it is not decoration — without it a flex row squashes the glyph before it wraps the label, and a 16px icon compressed to 11 is the artefact everyone sees and nobody can name.',

A chevron on an accordion, a tick in a checkbox, a tone mark on an alert whose words already say what went wrong — announcing any of those is the same sentence twice. The exceptions are the controls with no text at all. FloatingIconButton makes that the type’s problem: label is a required prop, so the code does not compile without it. Button does not — its JSDoc says an icon-only button REQUIRES aria-label and nothing checks it, so that is the one place a review still has to look. An icon-only control with no accessible name is the single most common way a design system ships something unusable.',

This documentation site has already paid it — the octocat in its own masthead is a hand-drawn path in apps/docs/src/components/GithubMark.tsx, filled with currentColor so it still follows the button into dark mode. @misoto22/design depends on lucide-react at ^1.33.0 as a dependency rather than a peer, so an app importing lucide directly resolves its own copy against its own range, and the failure lands on its upgrade rather than on ours.',
