/**
 * Everything about a component a reader might plausibly type.
 *
 * The name and the summary are the obvious half. The rest is the half that
 * makes a search useful rather than decorative: someone looking for
 * `aria-sort`, `asChild` or "focus trap" is looking for a component, and
 * matching only titles sends them away empty.
 *
 * This used to live in the sidebar's own filter. The sidebar's filter is gone —
 * it was a second search box beside ⌘K, answering the same question worse — so
 * the reach moved to the palette rather than being deleted with it.
 *
 * Short tokens only — prop NAMES and types, keyboard keys, the group. Not the
 * prose. cmdk renders an item's keywords into the DOM, so passing every prop
 * description put forty thousand characters of documentation into the text of
 * every page on the site; `haystack.test.ts` holds the line.
 *
 * The reach that matters survives it: someone types `aria-sort` or `asChild`,
 * and those are names.
 *
 * Built once at module load, from data the build already produced.
