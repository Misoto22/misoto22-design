/**
 * `DESIGN-CHANGELOG-001`, tested where the changelog is already tested.
 *
 * The rule lives in `.changeset/shape.mjs` and the `changeset` job in `pr.yml`
 * runs that same file, so there is one definition rather than a script and a
 * copy of its regexes in YAML. What is worth testing is the reading — where
 * this thinks a headline ends — because that is the half a wrapped line, a
 * backtick or a blank line can silently change.
 *
 * The last case runs it over the repository's own pending changesets. A rule
 * that only ever sees fixtures is a rule nobody notices has drifted off the
 * corpus it was written for.
