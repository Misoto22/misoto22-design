 * The site's own opinion, in the same sense as `PREVIEW_HEIGHTS` in the content
 * registry: it describes the frame, not the component, so the package has no
 * business answering it and a hand-kept map here is the honest place for it.
 *
 * `AppShell` states its own case in its prop docs — `contentAs` is documented
 * as the thing "an AppShell rendered INSIDE another page — a preview on a
 * documentation site" must pass, and `sidebarLabel` the same for the pair of
 * `complementary` landmarks that nesting makes. Every AppShell example on the
 * site already passes both. The panel was the one call site that did not.
 *
 * The six `aria-label`s below document no props at all — `Checkbox` is
 * `ComponentProps<typeof CheckboxPrimitive.Root>` and nothing more — so there
 * is no row to seed and no control to offer. Their accessible name comes from
 * the call site, and here the panel IS the call site: a preview of a naked,
 * unnamed checkbox is not the component being honest, it is the panel handing
 * a screen reader a button with nothing to announce.
 *
 * `Slider.label` is the same defect arrived at from the other end. It is a
 * REQUIRED, documented prop — but it types as `string | [string, string]`, one
 * name or one per thumb, and `prop-controls.ts` rightly refuses a union it
 * cannot enumerate. So the row exists, the control is `none`, and `placeholder`
 * does not reach it either: it seeds required ReactNode slots and empty text
 * fields, and this is neither. The panel therefore mounted `<Slider />` with no
 * name at all, and the thumb it renders carries `role="slider"`. It is the only
 * required naming prop in the package that lands this way — `Progress`,
 * `Combobox`, `Select` and `FloatingIconButton` all take a plain `string` and
 * are seeded by `placeholder`, and `Table.caption` likewise.
 *
 * Pinned values are the FRAME's, not the reader's, so they stay out of `Copy
 * JSX`. A documented prop keeps its row and its control, seated at the pinned
 * value rather than at the component's default, and the existing "changed, or
 * required" rule then leaves it out of the snippet until the reader moves it.
 * An undocumented one — the `aria-label`s — has no row to appear in.
 *
 * Nothing keeps this list current except the sweep that made it necessary:
 * `apps/docs/e2e/a11y.spec.ts` runs axe over this panel on every component
 * page, so a new form control with no name fails `button-name` the day it
 * lands.
