 * gap this fills, and it is why it is on every long page rather than on the
 * ones that happen to have asked.
 *
 * It is a real grid or flex COLUMN with a `sticky` block inside it, never a
 * floating overlay, so it can never cover the prose. The sticky offset is
 * `--scroll-offset`, the same token every heading's `scroll-margin-top` uses,
 * so the rail and the heading it points at come to rest against the same line.
