 * A page split into panels, without losing the anchors it already published.
 *
 * The split is worth doing: a component page is a reference and a sandbox
 * stacked into one column, and the reader arriving with "what does `variant`
 * do" has to scroll past everything the reader arriving with "how do I use this
 * at all" came for. Two panels is the honest shape.
 *
 * What a naive split costs is every deep link into the half that is now hidden.
 * So the strip reads the fragment on arrival and on every `hashchange`, opens
 * the panel that owns it, and performs the jump itself once that panel exists.
 * Read in an effect and not during render, deliberately: the server has no
 * fragment, and choosing a panel from one before hydration is a mismatch.
