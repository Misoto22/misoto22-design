/**
 * The accents this site can be re-skinned with.
 *
 * The White Reset itself is monochrome, and law 7 says so plainly: the accent
 * IS ink. That is not being walked back here. What this demonstrates is the
 * thing underneath the law — one pointer, `--clay`, that every component reads
 * through `--accent`. A consumer whose brand is not monochrome changes that one
 * token and the whole system follows, without touching a component.
 *
 * So: `ink` is the system. The rest are the same system wearing somebody
 * else's brand, and each one is picked to clear WCAG AA as text on paper, which
 * is the constraint that actually limits the choice.
 *
 * The IDS are the package's, not this file's. `data-accent` is a shipped theme
 * axis now, so the values live in `themes.css` and `theme-axes.test.ts` fails
 * when this list and those selectors disagree — the site used to hold both the
 * hues and the names, which is how it demonstrated an axis no consumer had.
 * What is left here is what a stylesheet cannot say: what to call each one, and
 * why anyone would reach for it.

/**
 * How a swatch paints itself, now that there is nothing to look a hue up in.
 *
 * The colour used to come from a `--swatch-*` variable this site declared on
 * `:root`, because `--accent` only ever holds the CHOSEN accent and a picker
 * has to draw all six at once. With the axis in the package the answer is
 * simpler and holds one fewer copy of every hue: put `data-accent` on the
 * swatch element itself and `themes.css` re-derives the whole chain THERE, so
 * `var(--accent)` on that element is its own accent rather than the page's.
