/**
 * The detail under one changelog headline, folded away until asked for.
 *
 * The entries in this repository carry their reasoning, which is the reason to
 * read them and the reason the page could not be scanned: a release ran to
 * two and a half thousand words, and the version a reader wanted to find was
 * eight screens down. Folding is the answer rather than cutting, because the
 * argument is the part worth keeping — a changelog that says only WHAT changed
 * is one every other library already has.
 *
 * The trigger counts what it hides. "Show 6 more" is a decision a reader can
 * make; "Detail" is one they have to make blind, and blind means opening every
 * one of them.
 *
 * `Collapsible` rather than a bare `<details>`: this is a design system, and a
 * site of its own that reaches past the package for a disclosure is the same
 * evidence of a gap that `CodeBlock` was. The cost is one client boundary
 * around the fold; the page around it stays server-rendered.
