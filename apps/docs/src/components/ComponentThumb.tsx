/**
 * The component itself, running, at the top of its card in the index.
 *
 * A gallery of names and one-line summaries makes a reader open a page to find
 * out what a thing looks like, and then go back. The card can answer that where
 * it is asked.
 *
 * It is the real component from the real example, not a picture: a screenshot
 * would need generating, would go stale silently, and would not follow the
 * reader's theme.
 *
 * `inert`, so the whole card stays one link and the index does not become a
 * hundred tab stops before the first heading.
 *
 * Scaled with `zoom`, not `transform: scale`. Scale only touches paint: the
 * layout box stays full size, so a component that MEASURES itself — the toggle
 * group's sliding pill, say — reads unscaled pixels and lands in the wrong
 * place, and the band clips a box larger than what it shows. `zoom` scales the
 * layout, so both stay honest.
 *
 * Mounted rather than server-rendered. The site is a static export, so its HTML
 * is months older than the visit — and an example that renders today's date
 * hydrates against a build-time "today" and mismatches. These are decorative
 * and `aria-hidden`, so nothing is lost by drawing them after mount, and the
 * shipped HTML stays a page of links rather than a page of apps.
