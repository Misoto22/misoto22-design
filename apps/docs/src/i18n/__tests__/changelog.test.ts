/**
 * The changelog's translation is keyed by the fingerprint of the English, so
 * drift can only ever produce a fallback to English — never a stale sentence
 * presented as current. There is therefore nothing to enforce about coverage;
 * an untranslated line is a backlog item, not a bug.
 *
 * An ORPHAN is different. A translation whose English exists nowhere is either
 * a typo in the key or a line that was reworded, and in both cases the Chinese
 * it carries will never be shown again — so it is dead weight that reads as
 * work already done.
 *
 * "Nowhere" has to include the changesets, though, and that is the narrowing
 * this file exists to make. `CHANGELOG.md` gets a release's text only when
 * `changeset version` runs, so a translation written before the bump had no
 * English behind it yet and read as an orphan — while one written after the
 * bump had nowhere to live, the release branch being rebuilt from scratch on
 * every push to `main`. A translation written before its release ships is not
 * an orphan; it is early, and the changeset is the proof. Text that is in no
 * release and in no changeset is still an orphan, which is the half that keeps
 * this a gate rather than a hole.
