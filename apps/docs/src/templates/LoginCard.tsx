/**
 * A sign-in card, assembled from the set — and deliberately drawn wrong.
 *
 * The screen every product has, shown in the state every product forgets to
 * design. A sign-in card in its happy path is four elements and proves nothing;
 * the interesting version is the one holding a rejected attempt, because a
 * failure has to arrive in three places at once and each of them is a different
 * component's job:
 *
 *   the form   an `Alert` saying what happened, at the top, where a reader who
 *              just pressed Enter is already looking
 *   the field  `Field error` — which is what wires `aria-invalid` and
 *              `aria-describedby` onto the input, so the message is announced
 *              rather than merely drawn
 *   the input  the ring the control draws for itself once it is invalid
 *
 * Draw only one of the three and the card looks finished and is not. The copy
 * is also the honest one: it does not say which of the two fields was wrong,
 * because saying so tells an attacker which addresses have accounts.
 *
 * No state, so no `'use client'` — the failure is the point, and it is static.
 * Every element is from the package.
