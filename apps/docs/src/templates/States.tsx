/**
 * The three states of one screen, side by side.
 *
 * Not a screen itself — the only entry here that is a pattern rather than a
 * page — and it exists because of how these three get built. The loaded state
 * gets designed. The other three get added later, one at a time, by whoever
 * hit them, and are never again seen next to each other. That is how a codebase
 * ends up with a skeleton that is a different shape from the list it stands in
 * for, an empty state that is a dead end with no action on it, and an error
 * page that reads like an empty folder.
 *
 * Put beside each other, the three failures are obvious in a second:
 *
 *   the skeleton   must be the SHAPE of what replaces it. The one here is the
 *                  record list from the middle panel, at the same row height,
 *                  so the page does not jump out from under the reader when the
 *                  data lands. One pulse on the wrapper, not one per bar.
 *   the empty      is not an error. Nothing went wrong, so the copy says what
 *                  to do next and carries the control that does it. An empty
 *                  state with no action is a dead end.
 *   the error      is not an empty state. Something failed, the reader did not
 *                  cause it, and the way back is the one thing on the panel
 *                  that is not prose.
 *
 * `EmptyState` and `ErrorState` are two components rather than one with a
 * `variant`, and this is the template that shows why: they say different kinds
 * of thing, and a shared component makes the two copies converge.
 *
 * No state, so no `'use client'`. Every element is from the package.
