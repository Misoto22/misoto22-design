 * axe, in a real browser, on every page — in both themes.

 * This is where the half a jsdom suite cannot reach gets checked:
 *
 *   colour-contrast   needs layout and computed colour; jsdom has neither, so
 *                     a unit axe pass silently skips the single rule a
 *                     monochrome system is most likely to break.
 *   region            needs a whole document to ask whether content sits
 *                     inside a landmark.
 *   page-has-heading-one, landmark-one-main
 *                     are properties of a page, not of a component.
 *
 * Both themes, because the dark side is a value swap on the same token names.
 * A contrast ratio that clears AA on paper can fail on ink, and nothing in the
 * light-mode pass would notice.

 * most likely to break a contrast or a naming rule, and it was the half
 * nothing swept. Clicking through costs one more axe run on a page that is

 * Resolves once nothing on the page is still moving.

 * axe reads COMPUTED colour, and `m22-panel-in` opens at `opacity: 0`
 * (`packages/design/src/styles/keyframes.css`). A sweep that starts the instant
 * the tab is clicked therefore measures the panel's text part-way through its
 * fade: `--ink-3-aa` is `#5c5c5c`, axe read `#8f8f8f`, and the contrast failure
 * it reported belongs to a colour that exists for a tenth of a second and is
 * gone by the time anybody reads the page.
 *
 * Waiting on the animations rather than on a duration. A fixed sleep is a
 * slower suite that still flakes the first time a curve gets longer, and it
 * would be waiting for a number rather than for the thing the number describes.
 *
 * Two ways this could hang, and neither does. Animations that never end —
 * Spinner, the indeterminate Progress bar, the StatusDot halo, all declared
 * `infinite` — have a `finished` that never settles, so an infinite iteration
 * count is left out. And an element with nothing running resolves an empty
 * `Promise.all` immediately, which is also the reduced-motion case: the media
 * query at the foot of `keyframes.css` sets `animation: none` on
 * `[data-m22-animated]`, so there is no animation to find and no wait to serve.
