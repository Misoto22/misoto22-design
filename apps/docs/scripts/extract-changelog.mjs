/**
 * Parses the package's `CHANGELOG.md` into the structure the changelog page
 * renders.
 *
 * A tolerant parser rather than a Markdown library, and deliberately: the file
 * has two shapes and both are headings, bullets and paragraphs. Pulling in a
 * Markdown pipeline to read two heading levels would be a dependency and a
 * sanitiser for no reading the page could not already do.
 *
 * The two shapes:
 *
 *   changesets  `## 0.3.0`, `### Minor Changes`, and one bullet per changeset
 *               carrying `[#21](…) [`sha`](…) Thanks [@who](…)! - ` before the
 *               first word, then an indented body that is itself a small
 *               document — paragraphs and a nested list.
 *   hand-written  the pre-1.0 history, `## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-05` with `### Added`
 *               and flat bullets.
 *
 * Both are read, package file first, so the page shows every release rather
 * than whichever file somebody remembered to point at. That is the defect this
 * replaces: the generator read the repository ROOT changelog, which stopped at
 * 0.1.0 the moment changesets took over and started writing the package one —
 * so the site's "what's new" silently froze two releases ago.
 *
 * The attribution prefix is lifted out of the sentence and kept as data. It is
 * useful (the pull request is where the argument is) and it is not a sentence
 * opener; leaving it inline meant every entry on the page began with the same
 * eleven words of boilerplate before saying anything.
 *
 * Anything it does not recognise becomes a paragraph, so a future entry cannot
 * silently vanish from the page.
