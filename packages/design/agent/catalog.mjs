/**
 * What each component IS — the half a parser cannot produce.
 *
 * Everything mechanical (props, types, defaults, JSDoc) is read out of
 * `src/components/**` by `scripts/extract-props.mjs`. What is left here is the
 * part someone has to decide: which group a component belongs to, its one-line
 * summary, when to reach for it instead of its neighbour, the promises it keeps
 * so a call site does not have to, and its keyboard contract key by key.
 *
 * This lives in the PACKAGE rather than in the documentation site because it
 * describes the components, not the site. It is also what makes the package
 * legible offline: `scripts/emit-agent.mjs` turns it plus the extracted props
 * into `dist/agent/`, which is what `npx misoto22-design docs <Component>`
 * prints and what the skill in `skills/` sends an agent to.
 *
 * The site reads the emitted `dist/agent/catalog.json`, the same way it already
 * reads `dist/tokens.json` rather than re-parsing the stylesheets. A second
 * hand-kept copy is a copy that goes stale, and the site would have been the
 * one people believed.
 *
 * `name` is the only identifier. The directory is the name, and the site's URL
 * slug is the name in kebab-case; `catalog.test.ts` fails if either stops being
 * true, so neither is authored twice. WHICH tree the directory sits in decides
 * the specifier, and that is read off the filesystem — see `ENTRY_POINTS`.
 *
 * The entries themselves live one group to a file under `catalog/`, and this
 * module concatenates them in `GROUPS` order. They are prose rather than rows —
 * several paragraphs per component once anatomy and practices are filled — and a
 * single list of ninety-two of them is a file only one hand can be writing at a
 * time. Nothing else moved: this is still the module every consumer imports, and
 * `catalog.test.ts` fails if the concatenation loses an entry, duplicates a name,
 * or lets one group’s entries drift into another’s.
