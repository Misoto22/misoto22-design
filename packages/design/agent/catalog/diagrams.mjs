/**
 * The Diagrams entries, and nothing else.
 *
 * `catalog.mjs` is still the module: it keeps the typedefs, the group list, the
 * slug rule and the axis table, and it assembles `CATALOG` by concatenating these
 * files in `GROUPS` order. Nothing imports this one directly.
 *
 * A group is the unit because an entry is prose, not a row — several paragraphs
 * per component — and ninety-two of them in one file is a file only one person can
 * be writing at a time.
 *
 * These render entirely on a server, and ship from `@misoto22/design/diagrams`
 * — see `ENTRY_POINTS`.
