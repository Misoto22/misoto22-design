/**
 * The package's own documentation, for the reader that installed it.
 *
 * A website is the wrong source for an agent writing against a pinned version:
 * it documents whatever shipped last, the agent is holding whatever is in
 * `node_modules`, and neither side can see the disagreement. Everything printed
 * here is generated at build time from the source in the same tarball, so the
 * answer is always about the version actually installed.
 *
 * It is also the cheap half of the deal. `docs --installed` is a few hundred
 * tokens and says what exists; `docs <Component>` is under a thousand and says
 * everything about one of them. The alternative an agent reaches for otherwise
 * is the whole of `llms-full.txt`, which is fifty times that and mostly about
 * components it is not using.
