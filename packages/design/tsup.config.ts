/**
 * `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=…` in the build script is not optional: the
 * declaration pass bundles every entry through rollup, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
 * pins rollup to its WASM build (the native binding crashes the DTS worker on
 * GitHub's runners), and WASM rollup over 36 entries exhausts the worker's
 * default heap. It OOMs in CI and survives locally, which is the worst shape a
 * build failure can take.
 *
 * The number tracks the entry count and has to be raised with it. 6144 built
 * 120 entries; at 133 — the charts and the figures alongside the typography and
 * layout primitives — the worker died again, and 8192 is what clears it.
 * GitHub's ubuntu runners have 16 GB, so the ceiling is not close.
 *
 * `bundle: false` compiles each source file 1:1 (transpile, not bundle), so the
 * output mirrors the module graph and esbuild keeps each file's `'use client'`
 * banner verbatim — a Next.js App Router app then gets correct server/client
 * boundaries (Button/Card stay server-renderable; Dialog/Switch/etc. carry the
 * client directive). Dependencies stay external imports; fixImportsPlugin adds
 * the `.js` extensions that ESM resolution needs on relative imports.
