/**
 * Development warnings, written for the reader most likely to hit them.
 *
 * The skill in this package documents a handful of ways to misuse a component
 * that fail SILENTLY — a `Field` whose child is a wrapper wires no label, an
 * icon-only `Button` with no accessible name renders perfectly and is invisible
 * to a screen reader. Documentation is the wrong place for those on its own: it
 * only helps a reader who went looking, and the whole problem is that nothing
 * told them to look.
 *
 * So the component says it, at the moment it happens. The shape follows what an
 * agent needs to repair its own call without asking anyone: a stable `code` it
 * can branch on, the `field` that caused it, an imperative one-line `fix`, and
 * where to get the rest. A message that only says "invalid props" makes an
 * agent guess, and it guesses by trying things.
 *
 * Three constraints this has to keep:
 *
 * - **Dev only.** Every call site is behind `process.env.NODE_ENV`, which the
 *   consumer's bundler replaces and then drops. Nothing here reaches a
 *   production bundle.
 * - **Once per problem.** React renders twice in StrictMode and again on every
 *   state change; a warning printed each time is noise that trains people to
 *   ignore it.
 * - **Never throws.** A warning that breaks the render is worse than the bug it
 *   describes, and this runs during render.

 * `process.env.NODE_ENV`, without pulling Node's types into a browser library.
 *
 * Declared module-locally rather than in a `.d.ts`: an ambient `process` there

 * Node types. The `typeof` guard is what makes it safe in a bundle that never
