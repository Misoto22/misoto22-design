/**
 * @misoto22/design/diagrams — the public entry.
 *
 * Five renderers for the five diagram shapes software actually needs, plus the
 * chrome a reader explores one with. They ship from their own entry point
 * rather than from the package root for one reason: a page that renders a Badge
 * should not be paying for a routing engine. Nothing under `src/components`
 * imports anything here, so the main barrel stays the size it was.
 *
 * The specification types mirror
 * [archify](https://github.com/tt-a1i/archify)'s published JSON schemas, so a
 * document authored for that tool renders here with no translation step — in
 * this system's own monochrome terms rather than in archify's palette.
 *
 * The look ships with the rest of the package:
 *
 *   import '@misoto22/design/styles.css'
 *
 * Everything below is a consumer contract. Adding an export is cheap; changing
 * or removing one is a breaking change (DESIGN-API-001).

/**
 * The export pipeline the menu runs, for a caller who needs a different one.
 *
 * `DiagramExportMenu` is five decisions already made — a plate behind the
 * artwork, 2× raster, a 1200 × 630 share card — and a caller who wants any of
 * them differently had nothing to build on: the serialiser is where the hard
 * half lives (resolving `var(--ink)` against the live element, so the file is
 * not an invisible rectangle), and it was private.
