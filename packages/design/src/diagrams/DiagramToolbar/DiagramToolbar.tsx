/**
 * A bar of actions that belong to the surface underneath them.
 *
 * The package already has `FloatingIconButton` for ONE pinned action. This is
 * the container for several — which is a different problem, because several
 * pinned buttons need to read as one object rather than as a scatter: one
 * plate, one border, hairlines between the groups, and a single `role="toolbar"`
 * so a screen reader announces a toolbar instead of six unrelated buttons.
 *
 * `role="toolbar"` also changes the keyboard contract, and callers should know
 * what they are opting into: arrow keys are expected to move between the
 * controls and Tab is expected to leave the bar. This component does not
 * implement roving focus for you — a bar of three buttons where Tab visits all
 * three is honest and fine — so pass `placement="inline"` and skip the role by
 * using a plain `<div>` if that is not what you want.
 *
 * @example
 * <DiagramToolbar label="Diagram actions" placement="floating">
 *   <DiagramToolbarGroup>
 *     <Button size="sm" variant="ghost">Theme</Button>
 *   </DiagramToolbarGroup>
 *   <DiagramToolbarGroup>
 *     <DiagramExportMenu targetRef={svg} title="Request path" />
 *   </DiagramToolbarGroup>
 * </DiagramToolbar>
