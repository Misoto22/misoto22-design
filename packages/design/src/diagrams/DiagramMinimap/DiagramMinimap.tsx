/**
 * Where you are in something bigger than the window.
 *
 * Two things at once, and both are needed: a miniature of the whole artwork,
 * and a rectangle showing which part of it the frame is currently over. The
 * miniature alone answers "what is there"; the rectangle answers "and where am
 * I", which is the question a reader who has just panned twice actually has.
 *
 * THE RECTANGLE IS DERIVED, never stored. Its position comes out of the
 * canvas's own view — the same three numbers the canvas is already transforming
 * by — divided by the map's scale, and clamped to the plate: a viewport that
 * has been panned past the edge of the artwork is a viewport half over blank
 * paper, and drawing the rectangle out there claims the map extends somewhere
 * it does not. Keeping a second copy of "where the viewport is" is how a
 * minimap comes to disagree with the thing it is a map of, and a map that
 * disagrees is worse than none.
 *
 * NOTHING IS DRAWN UNTIL THE ARTWORK HAS A SIZE. `content` is usually a
 * measurement, and a measurement's first value is zero — so the scale would be
 * 1, the miniature would be the artwork's top-left corner at full size, and the
 * rectangle would sit over it meaning nothing. An empty plate for one frame is
 * the honest version of "not yet".
 *
 * CLICKING RECENTRES rather than jumping. `onSeek` reports a point in CONTENT
 * coordinates, which is what a canvas's `centerOn` takes. The minimap does not
 * move anything itself: it has no authority over the view, it only says where
 * the reader pointed. A drag keeps seeking, and only a drag that STARTED on the
 * map does — a button held down somewhere else and dragged across is not this
 * component's gesture to answer.
 *
 * @example
 * const canvas = useRef<DiagramCanvasHandle>(null)
 * const [view, setView] = useState({ scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0 })
 * // …
 * <DiagramMinimap
 *   content={{ width: 1400, height: 620 }}
 *   view={view}
 *   onSeek={(x, y) => canvas.current?.centerOn(x, y)}
 * >
 *   <ArchitectureFigure spec={spec} heading={false} legend="hidden" cards={false} />
 * </DiagramMinimap>
