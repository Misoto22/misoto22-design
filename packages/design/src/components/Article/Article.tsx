/**
 * The long-form reading surface.
 *
 * Everything a Markdown pipeline can emit — headings, prose, lists, tables,
 * quotations, code, figures, footnotes, MathML — set in this system's type,
 * colour and rules. The styles live in `article.css` rather than in a class
 * string, because the input is not JSX: there is no component to hang a class
 * on when the markup arrived as a string, so the contract has to be the element
 * names themselves.
 *
 * That file is published on its own as `@misoto22/design/article.css`, so a
 * site with its own Markdown pipeline can take the reading surface without
 * taking the components — which is the case this exists for. Three sites
 * hand-rolling a prose stylesheet is three prose stylesheets that drift.
 *
 * Composable either way: pass `html` for a rendered string, or children for
 * real elements — one or the other, never both. `html` wins when both arrive,
 * and says so in development: `html=""` is still `html`, which made losing a
 * page of children a thing that could happen without a word. A post that mixes
 * the two — prose with a `Diagram` dropped into the middle — renders its blocks
 * in order and gives each one an `Article`. Inside one, these rules BEAT a component's utilities:
 * `article.css` is imported unlayered while Tailwind's utilities sit in
 * `@layer utilities`, and an unlayered rule wins over a layered one whatever
 * either one's specificity is. That is the mechanism rather than an accident —
 * it is what lets a `Markdown` paragraph, a `Text` carrying `m-0`, give its
 * margin up to the article's rhythm. A component that has to hold a property
 * inside an article needs an inline style, not a class.
 *
 * @example
 * <Article html={renderedMarkdown} />
 * @example
 * <Article>
 *   <h1>The White Reset</h1>
 *   <p className="lead">A monochrome system for software and writing.</p>
 *   <Diagram spec={spec} />
 * </Article>
