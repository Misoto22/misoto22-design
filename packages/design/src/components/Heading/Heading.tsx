/**
 * What each level looks like when nobody says otherwise — and the reason this

 *
 * Read the gaps. `1 → title` then `2 → heading` SKIPS `lead`, because the
 * ladder's steps sit close together on purpose: it separates records of the
 * same kind, not a heading from its own sub-heading. `--fs-lead` over
 * `--fs-heading` is a ratio of 1.14 and reads as a rendering accident;
 * `--fs-title` over `--fs-heading` is 1.86 and reads as a hierarchy.
 *
 * So the correct pairing is what a caller gets for free, and stepping off the
 * ladder costs a prop and is visible in review. This is the same map
 * `article.css` applies to rendered Markdown, which is what makes a component
 * page and a post read as one publication.

 * keep the outline (a section title set at 20px because it is the fourth level
 * down). Both are one prop away from being right, so there are two.
 *
 * `level` is the document. `size` is the page. The default binds them through
 * the system's ladder, so writing only `level` is correct — and the moment they
 * come apart, the call site says so.
 *
 * Set in the editorial serif at weight 400, like every heading in the system.
 * It also carries `scroll-margin-top`, so a heading given an `id` and linked
 * from a table of contents comes to rest below the masthead rather than under
 * it.
 *
 * @example
 * <Heading level={1}>The White Reset</Heading>
 * @example
 * // Third level in the outline, page-title sized.
 * <Heading level={3} size="title">Colour</Heading>
