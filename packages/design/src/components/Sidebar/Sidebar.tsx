/**
 * The drawer, written as CSS rather than decided in JavaScript.
 *
 * The first version asked `matchMedia` and rendered a different tree from the
 * answer. That answer does not exist until an effect runs, so the server sent —
 * and a phone painted — a 256px column beside a 390px screen, and the page
 * scrolled sideways until React caught up. A layout that is wrong for a frame
 * is wrong: it is the first frame, it is the one a reader sees on a slow phone,
 * and on this site's own suite it was a real failure on every route.
 *
 * So the element is the same in both states and the media query decides, which
 * is what a media query is. JavaScript is left with the two things CSS cannot
 * say — `inert`, and whether to render the scrim — and being a frame late on
 * either of those changes nothing anyone can see.
 *
 * The breakpoints are NAMED rather than numeric because these are literal class
 * strings: Tailwind emits what it can read in the source, and a class built
 * from a runtime number is a class that does not exist. Naming them also puts
 * the rail on the same four steps as everything else in the page around it,
 * which a number never quite lands on.
 *
 * It slides on `inset-inline-start`, not on `translate-x`. A transform is a
 * PHYSICAL axis, so the closed drawer needed an `rtl:` twin of every offset —
 * which is the physical-with-a-patch shape this system forbids everywhere else,
 * and which cost 3.6 kB of stylesheet on its own: each `rtl:` selector carries
 * the whole `:lang()` list, four breakpoints deep. A logical inset needs no
 * twin, is one property in each direction, and puts the rail back under the
 * same rule as every `ps-` and `me-` in the package.

 *
 * Composed rather than configured: a rail is a header, a scrolling middle and a
 * footer, and every product wants different things in all three. What this owns
 * is the part that is the same everywhere — the width, the edge, the scroll
 * behaviour, and what happens when it closes.
 *
 * **Closing has three shapes**, and `collapsible` on the provider picks one.
 * `icon` keeps the rail and drops the labels, which is right when the rows are
 * a fixed set a reader learns the shape of. `offcanvas` takes the whole rail
 * away, which is right when the rows are a long index nobody memorises.
 * `none` is a rail that does not close.
 *
 * The trigger belongs INSIDE the rail — `SidebarHeader` places it — rather than
 * out in an application's masthead. A control that hides a thing should live on
 * the thing: in the masthead it is one more anonymous icon in a row of them,
 * and nothing connects it to the column it operates.
 *
 * **Under the provider's `breakpoint` it is a drawer**, not a column: `fixed`
 * against its own edge, over a scrim, and `inert` while closed. Merely
 * translating it off-screen is not closed — it keeps focus and it is still read
 * aloud, so a shut drawer puts its whole index between the reader and the page
 * they were on. The scrim is a real button, because tapping beside a drawer is
 * how a drawer is closed and that gesture has to exist for a keyboard too.
 *
 * `fixed` resolves against the viewport unless an ancestor has a `transform`,
 * `filter` or `perspective`, which makes that ancestor the containing block
 * instead. Do not put one on an element wrapping the provider, or the drawer
 * opens inside it.
 *
 * @example
 * <SidebarProvider>
 *   <Sidebar label="Documentation">
