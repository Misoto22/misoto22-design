/**
 * A flow or architecture diagram, drawn out of the system's own parts.
 *
 * The alternative it replaces is a fenced block of box-drawing characters —
 * `┌──────┬──────┐` — which is a picture rendered in a font chosen for code. It
 * inherits the code block's frame and scrollbar, so a diagram reads as terminal
 * output; it cannot wrap, so on a phone it either overflows or is scaled to
 * nothing; the box edges are text, so a screen reader reads the rules out loud;
 * and none of it responds to the theme.
 *
 * The other alternative is a diagramming library, which is several hundred
 * kilobytes of layout engine, renders after hydration, and draws in its own
 * palette. This is neither: hairline frames on the radius scale, mono labels,
 * the muted step for anything supporting — so a diagram belongs to the page it
 * sits on. It server-renders, because it is markup.
 *
 * NESTING IS CONTAINMENT, which is what most architecture diagrams actually
 * describe: this is inside that, and these two sit beside each other. Edges are
 * for the sequence between siblings, not for arbitrary wiring — a diagram that
 * needs arbitrary wiring is a diagram that wants a drawing, and this will not
 * pretend otherwise.
 *
 * It takes a spec rather than markup, so a fenced ```diagram block in an
 * article and a hand-written figure on a page are one renderer and one look —
 * and a wrong diagram is corrected by editing data.
 *
 * @example
 * <Diagram
 *   spec={{
 *     caption: 'One request, end to end.',
 *     edges: [{ from: 'edge', to: 'app', label: 'HTTPS' }],
 *     nodes: [
 *       { id: 'edge', label: 'Edge', note: 'CDN' },
 *       { id: 'app', label: 'Application', children: [
 *         { label: 'Router', accent: true },
 *         { label: 'Handlers' },
 *       ] },
 *     ],
 *   }}
 * />
