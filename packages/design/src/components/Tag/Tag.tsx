/**
 * A subject label — a topic, a technology, a filter facet — that can filter
 * with `onClick` and be dismissed with `onRemove`.
 *
 * Distinct from `Badge`, which carries a state or a count. A tag names what
 * something is ABOUT, so several sit together in a row and the reader scans
 * them; a badge is one fact about one record.
 *
 * This is where a `Token` component would have gone. It was not built: a token
 * is a tag with a remove button, and the difference between the two is one
 * prop, not one component. The system already ships three things that look
 * alike — `Badge`, `Tag`, `StatusPill` — and a fourth whose whole distinction
 * is an X on the end would be the one a call site picks by coin toss.
 *
 * Presentational until it is given a handler, and the component owns both
 * interactive cases rather than leaving one to a wrapper at the call site.
 * That is not a convenience: a wrapping `<button>` around a chip that already
 * holds the remove `<button>` is a button inside a button, which no parser
 * keeps and no accessibility tree reports the way it was written. Given both,
 * the chip renders the label and the X as SIBLING buttons — the label takes
 * the leading padding with it, so it is the whole of the chip up to the X
 * rather than the words with dead padding around them.
 *
 * @example
 * <Tag>TypeScript</Tag>
 * @example
 * <Tag active={on} onClick={toggle}>Rust</Tag>
 * @example
 * <Tag onRemove={() => drop('rust')} removeLabel="Remove Rust filter">Rust</Tag>
 * @example
 * // Both: a filter the reader can toggle and also take out of the row.
 * <Tag active={on} onClick={toggle} onRemove={drop} removeLabel="Remove Rust filter">Rust</Tag>
