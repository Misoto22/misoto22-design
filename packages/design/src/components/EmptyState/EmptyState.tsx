   * The heading level `title` opens, in the document the empty state lands in.
   *
   * Defaults to `2`, which is the placement this component is sized for: it
   * stands in for a whole view inside a page that already has an `h1`, so the
   * level below that one is the level that does not leave a hole in heading
   * navigation. Under a section that already has its own `h2`, pass `3`.
   *
   * The default was `3` and fixed, which was wrong in the ordinary case and
   * impossible to correct — the documentation could name the rule but a caller
   * had no prop to follow it with. `2` is the common case rather than a
   * compromise, and it is optional rather than required because the correct
   * placement has one answer often enough that making every existing call site
   * restate it would buy nothing.
   *
   * The size does not follow the level. `title` renders at `--fs-sub` at every
   * level, because moving a state down the outline is a fact about the document
   * and not a request for smaller type.

 * Distinct from `ErrorState`: nothing went wrong here, so the copy says what to

 * shared temptation — one component with a `variant` — produces error pages
 * that read like empty folders.
 *
 * @example
 * <EmptyState
 *   icon={Inbox}
 *   title="No projects yet"
 *   description="Create your first project to get started."
 *   action={<Button>New project</Button>}
 * />
 * @example
 * // Inside a section that already has its own heading.
 * <EmptyState level={3} title="No invoices yet" />
