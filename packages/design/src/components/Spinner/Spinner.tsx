/**
 * The system's one "working" indicator.
 *
 * A ring, not a blurred glow and not a shimmer: the White Reset has no light
 * source, so depth and softness are not available to it. The leading quarter is
 * the only thing that distinguishes the ring from a plain circle, which is why
 * the track stays a hairline — a spinner is a hint that time is passing, not a
 * feature of the page.
 *
 * It spins under `motion-safe` only. A reader who has asked for less motion
 * gets a static ring, which still reads as "not finished" because the leading
 * quarter is darker than the track.
 *
 * For a wait long enough that the reader would otherwise wonder whether the
 * page is broken, prefer `Skeleton` — a shape that describes what is coming
 * beats a dot that describes nothing.
 *
 * `className` reaches the RING, alongside `size` and `tone`, and overrides
 * them: every utility a caller has for a spinner is about the ring, and merged
 * onto the wrapper instead `className="size-8"` grew an invisible box around an
 * unchanged 18px circle. Layout still works from there — the wrapper is
 * `inline-flex` and takes the ring's margin box as its own.
 *
 * @example
 * <Spinner size="lg" label="Loading projects" />
 * @example
 * // Inside a filled button, where the ground is ink:
 * <Spinner size="sm" tone="current" label={null} />
