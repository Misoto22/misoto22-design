 * `html` the block renders `code` as text, which is what a template, a README
 * or an agent's answer has and all it needs.
 *
 * `lineNumbers` and `highlightLines` belong to the plain form only, and that is
 * enforced in the TYPE rather than left to a note. They are a per-LINE
 * structure, and `html` is one opaque string this component is not going to
 * start parsing. Typed apart, passing both is a compile error at the call site;
 * typed together it is a prop that renders nothing and says nothing.
 *
 * The plain form is written first because the emitted prop table reads the
 * first arm of a union: this way `lineNumbers` documents as `boolean` rather
 * than as the `never` the other arm gives it.

/**
 * A multi-line snippet, on a plate, with a way to take it away.
 *
 * The strip along the top carries the title, the language and the copy button,
 * and it is there whenever there is anything to put in it. It is deliberately
 * not a hover affordance: a control that appears on hover does not exist on a
 * touch screen, which is where a reader is most likely to want the snippet and
 * least able to select it by hand.
 *
 * Line numbers live INSIDE their own line's row rather than in a parallel gutter
 * column. Two columns sharing a line-height align right up until one of them
 * wraps, ships a different font, or scrolls on its own; a number that is a child
 * of the line it numbers cannot come apart from it. The cost is that a number
 * scrolls away with its line: it is inside the scrolling box, not in a gutter
 * beside it. A gutter that stayed put would be a second column to keep in sync,
 * which is the failure this avoids.
 *
 * The body is a focusable, named `role="group"`, and both halves of that are
 * load-bearing. Focusable, because a scrollable box whose contents are not
 * themselves focusable is unreachable by keyboard — there is nothing to Tab to
 * and therefore no way to press an arrow key at it, so the right-hand half of a
 * long line does not exist for anyone not using a mouse. Named, because a tab
 * stop that announces nothing lands the reader in an anonymous box and leaves
 * them to work out what they have arrived in.
 *
 * `group` rather than `region`, and that is the deliberate half. A region is a
 * LANDMARK — one of the handful of major sections a reader navigates a whole
 * page by — and a snippet is not one of those. Three fenced blocks in one
 * article would put three landmarks called "Code" into that map, which is
 * exactly the noise the `landmark-unique` rule exists to catch, and it would
 * push the page's real landmarks down a list nobody can now skim. `group`
 * carries the same accessible name to the same reader on the way in, and
 * carries it nowhere else.
 *
 * For a function name inside a sentence, reach for `Code`.
 *
 * @example
 * <CodeBlock code="pnpm add @misoto22/design" lang="bash" />
 * @example
 * <CodeBlock
 *   title="cn.ts"
 *   lang="ts"
 *   lineNumbers
 *   highlightLines={[2]}
 *   maxHeight="24rem"
 *   code={source}
 * />
 * @example
 * // Highlighted at build time by the site's own Shiki pass.
 * <CodeBlock code={source} html={highlighted} lang="tsx" />
