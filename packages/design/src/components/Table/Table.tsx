 * A ruled data table.
 *
 * Wrapped in its own horizontally scrolling container, because a table is the
 * one block that legitimately exceeds the measure — and a page that scrolls
 * sideways as a whole is a layout bug, while a table that does is a table.
 *
 * That container is focusable, and it has to be. A scrollable region whose
 * contents are not themselves focusable is unreachable by keyboard: there is no
 * element to Tab to and therefore no way to press an arrow key at it, so the
 * columns past the fold simply do not exist for anyone not using a mouse.
 *
 * It is also POSITIONED, which is not decoration. `sr-only` is
 * `position: absolute`, so a visually-hidden label in a cell resolves against
 * the nearest positioned ancestor — and with none between it and the document,
 * it escapes the scroll container and every `overflow-hidden` around it, and
 * widens the page by however far the table happens to be scrolled.
 *
 * No zebra striping at any border setting. In a monochrome system a striped row
 * is a second surface competing with the page ground, and the hairline between
 * rows is already enough to track a line across.
 *
 * @example
 * <Table caption="Deploy history">
 *   <THead><TR><TH>Commit</TH><TH align="end" sortable sortDirection={dir} onSort={sort}>Duration</TH></TR></THead>
 *   <TBody><TR><TD>a1b2c3d</TD><TD align="end">2m 14s</TD></TR></TBody>

 * @example
 * <Table caption="Inventory" borders="bordered-grid" density="compact">…</Table>
