/**
 * A Markdown string, rendered as this system's components.
 *
 * The gap it fills is content nobody on this side wrote: a comment, a README, a
 * model's answer, a description out of a database. `Article` cannot take those
 * — it renders HTML through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and is documented as
 * trusted-input-only — and until now the alternative was a `<pre>` or a
 * sanitiser bolted onto a styling primitive.
 *
 * IT IS NOT AN `Article`, and the two do not merge. `Markdown` turns a string
 * into nodes; `Article` is the reading column those nodes can sit in. It
 * renders a FRAGMENT rather than a wrapper, which is what makes that nesting
 * work — `Article`'s rhythm is a direct-child combinator, so any element
 * between the two, `display: contents` included, would cost every paragraph
 * its spacing.
 *
 * ── It brings type and colour, and no vertical rhythm ──
 *
 * The nodes carry the system's faces and inks on their own, so one of these
 * looks right in isolation. It is not SPACED in isolation: every node renders
 * `m-0`, and a fragment has no box of its own to put a gap in. Nor does a
 * uniform `gap` on a container reproduce it, because prose spacing is not
 * uniform — `article.css` gives a heading 2.25em above and 0.75em below, which
 * is what sits a heading with the paragraph it introduces rather than midway
 * between two. For anything longer than a sentence — a comment, an answer, a
 * README — put it in `<Article as="div">` and get the real rhythm for the cost
 * of one element.
 *
 * ── A fenced code block brings a client component with it ──
 *
 * The renderer is plain functions and has no state, but a fenced block renders
 * `CodeBlock`, which is `'use client'` and arrives with `useState`,
 * `useEffect` and two icons. That is correct — the copy button is the reason
 * the block exists — but "server-rendered" only holds for content with no code
 * in it, which is worth knowing before this goes into a route that has no
 * client bundle yet.
 *
 * ── Why there is no parser in `dependencies` ──
 *
 * Three options, and the decision is written here because it is the one a
 * reader will want to argue with.
 *
 *  1. BUNDLE A PARSER. markdown-it is the obvious pick, and the documentation
 *     site already depends on it — but the site is an app and this is a
 *     library, where the dependency list is part of the contract every consumer
 *     signs. Measured with the same esbuild pass `check:size` uses, markdown-it
 *     is 110.7 kB minified against the 38.9 kB this package had left under its
 *     bundle budget. It is not close, and "we will raise the budget" is how a
 *     design system becomes the largest thing on a page.
 *  2. TAKE PRE-PARSED HTML, the way `Article` does. Cheapest, and wrong for the
 *     case this exists for: HTML from an untrusted author is the input this is
 *     supposed to make safe, and it cannot carry `headingLevelStart` or stable
 *     heading ids without the component parsing markup back apart to find them.
 *  3. PARSE THE SUBSET WE STYLE, and take a `parse` function for the rest.
 *     Chosen. The block grammar is line-based and small (see `parse.ts`), it
 *     emits React elements rather than markup — so there is no
 *     `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in this path at all, no sanitiser to configure
 *     and no sanitiser to get wrong — and a consumer who needs tables,
 *     footnotes or task lists passes `parse` and keeps every other promise the
 *     component makes.
 *
 * Headings carry an `id` slugged from their own text and deduplicated within
 * the document, so a table of contents can link to them without the caller
 * post-processing the DOM to find out where they went.
 *
 * A link in the source is validated here, at the boundary: a scheme that is not
 * `http`, `https`, `mailto` or `tel` never becomes a link, and one that leaves
 * for another site carries `rel="noreferrer nofollow"` — so an author the page
 * does not trust cannot spend its ranking or read its URL out of the `Referer`.
 *
 * @example
 * // A comment body or an answer: the reading column is what spaces it.
 * <Article as="div">
 *   <Markdown headingLevelStart={3} idPrefix="answer">{answer}</Markdown>
 * </Article>
 * @example
 * // A whole document, in the column it was written for.
 * <Article><Markdown>{readme}</Markdown></Article>
 * @example
 * // Tables and footnotes, via the consumer's own pipeline.
 * <Markdown parse={(source) => toMarkdownNodes(md.parse(source, {}))}>{post}</Markdown>
