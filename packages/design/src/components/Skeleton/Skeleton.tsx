 * The fill every skeleton part is drawn from: `--stone`, at the height of one

 * which implies a light source; the White Reset has none, so the sweep reads as
 * a bug rather than as loading. The whole page breathes together instead —
 * see `SkeletonPage`, which owns the single pulse.
 *
 * `h-3` is a default rather than a design. A `<div>` is already full width, so
 * height was the one dimension a caller could omit and get nothing for — a
 * bare `<Skeleton />` was a zero-height box, which is not a small skeleton but
 * an absent one. Twelve pixels is the height `SkeletonLine` already chose, and
 * any class the caller passes replaces it.
 *
 * @example
 * <Skeleton className="h-3 w-40 rounded-(--radius-pill)" />

 * promises a layout and then the page jumps out from under the reader. Compose
 * the parts to match the real thing, and change both together.
