 * the week's ends), the `aria-live` announcement when the month changes, week
 * numbering, the first day of the week varying by locale, and the fact that

 * Every class is replaced rather than layered over the library's stylesheet, so
 * nothing here depends on a CSS file this package does not control — but the
 * library's OWN class is kept on each slot, because passing a class REPLACES it
 * and every `.rdp-*` selector downstream depends on those.
 *
 * The month names follow `locale`. The picker's own chrome — the two panels and
 * the four chevrons that browse them — follows `CalendarLabels`, because
 * `locale` cannot supply strings this package invented.
 *
 * @example
 * <Calendar mode="single" selected={date} onSelect={setDate} />
 * @example
 * // A birth date: widen the years, since the default span is deliberately short.
