/**
 * The mark on a link that leaves the page — outbound, or on to a full index.
 *
 * Call sites used to write a bare `↗` inside the link text, which inherited the
 * link's own size (a 17px arrow beside a 17px word, competing with it) and was
 * read aloud as "north east arrow" because nothing hid it.
 *
 * `inline-block` is load-bearing twice over: it stops an underlined parent
 * drawing its rule through the glyph, and it is what `align` is measured
 * against. Sized in `em`, so it tracks whatever type it sits beside; coloured
 * against paper, so a call site on a reversed plate passes its own colour.
 *
 * @example
 * <a href="https://example.com">Read the paper<LinkArrow /></a>
