/**
 * @misoto22/design — public entry.
 *
 * Components export from here; the look ships separately as CSS:
 *
 *   import '@misoto22/design/styles.css'    // compiled Tailwind + tokens + fonts
 *
 * or, for an app that already compiles Tailwind itself, the portable layers on
 * their own:
 *
 *   import '@misoto22/design/tokens.css'    // primitives, plus data-mode and data-density
 *   import '@misoto22/design/semantic.css'  // roles
 *   import '@misoto22/design/themes.css'    // the other six theming axes
 *   import '@misoto22/design/keyframes.css' // motion
 *
 * All four, or the theming attributes are attributes that do nothing: every
 * axis but `data-mode` and `data-density` is declared only in `themes.css`, and
 * an app that skips it writes `data-radius="sharp"` and gets no error, no
 * warning and no corner.
 *
 * Everything below is a consumer contract. Adding an export is cheap; changing
 * or removing one is a breaking change (DESIGN-API-001).
