 * chart is playing. A label that names the next action says it once.
 *
 * The live region carries the RANGE announcement before each series, not a line
 * per point: a fourteen-point run would interrupt itself fourteen times and the
 * listener would hear none of the tones. The per-point readout beside the
 * button is `aria-hidden` for the same reason — it is there for a sighted
 * reader following along.
