 * and also step the zoom or take the numbers away. The two drive one window, so
 * they cannot disagree.

 *   <LineChart.Toolbar exports={['png', 'csv']} />

 * The row of controls above a plot.
 *
 * A `group` rather than a `toolbar`: the toolbar role promises roving
 * tabindex, and a row of five ordinary buttons that each take a tab stop is
 * both simpler and correct. Every control is a real `<button>` with a real
 * accessible name, repeated as a native `title` for sighted pointer users.
 *
 * There are five controls at most and no overflow menu, which is a size
 * decision as much as a design one: a row that can never exceed five 44px
 * targets does not need one, and the menu component it would take is Radix
 * Menu — around 60 kB that every consumer of every cartesian chart would ship
 * whether or not they compose a toolbar, because the chart reaches it
 * statically. A caller with less width drops controls (`zoom={false}`,
 * `exports={['csv']}`) rather than hiding them behind a second gesture. The
 * hover hints come off the native `title` for the same reason.
 *
 * Sized `md`, which is 44px at the default density. An icon button is exactly
 * the control where the pointer-target floor is most often quietly missed.
 *
 * ## What each export contains
 *
 * The PNG is a picture of the plot, so it shows the CURRENT window — zoom in
 * and the export follows. The CSV is the whole dataset, like the figure's
 * hidden data table, because a spreadsheet silently missing the rows the
 * reader had scrolled past is data loss they cannot see.
 *
 * Composed for you by `<ChartControls>`; reach for it directly only when you
 * are building a chart root of your own.
 *
 * @example
 * <ChartToolbar
 *   targetRef={plotRef}
 *   title="Visitors per day"
 *   rows={data}
 *   columns={columns}
 *   zoomState={zoom}
 *   exports={['png', 'csv']}
