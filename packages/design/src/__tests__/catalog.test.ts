/**
 * The catalog is the one hand-written file in the package, which makes it the
 * one file that can fall out of step with the source beside it. It is also what
 * `scripts/emit-agent.mjs` turns into the offline documentation an agent reads,
 * so a wrong entry here is not a blank page — it is a confident answer about a
 * component that does not exist.
 *
 * The identity checks matter more than they look. `name` is the ONLY identifier
 * the catalog authors: the directory is the name and the site's slug is the
 * name in kebab-case, and both the emitter and the documentation site rely on
 * that. The moment one component breaks the rule, the derivation has to become
 * a third authored field everywhere, which is the duplication this replaced.
