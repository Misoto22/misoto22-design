/**
 * Two questions a design system should be able to answer about itself, and
 * usually cannot: how big is it, and does importing one component drag in the
 * other forty-six?
 *
 * The second is the one that matters. A package can be perfectly tree-shakeable
 * in principle and not be in practice — one `index.ts` side effect, one
 * component importing a barrel instead of a file, and every consumer ships the
 * calendar to render a badge. Nothing about that is visible in review; it shows
 * up as a bundle that grew and nobody knows when.
 *
 * So this bundles a single component with esbuild and asserts the result stays
 * a small fraction of the whole. The budgets are deliberately loose: they exist
 * to catch a step change, not to police a kilobyte.
